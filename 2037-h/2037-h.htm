<h1>NOVEL NOTES</h1>
<p>To Big-Hearted, Big-Souled, Big-Bodied friend Conan Doyle</p>
<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
<p>Years ago, when I was very small, we lived in a great house in a
long, straight, brown-coloured street, in the east end of London.&nbsp;
It was a noisy, crowded street in the daytime; but a silent, lonesome
street at night, when the gas-lights, few and far between, partook of
the character of lighthouses rather than of illuminants, and the tramp,
tramp of the policeman on his long beat seemed to be ever drawing nearer,
or fading away, except for brief moments when the footsteps ceased,
as he paused to rattle a door or window, or to flash his lantern into
some dark passage leading down towards the river.</p>
<p>The house had many advantages, so my father would explain to friends
who expressed surprise at his choosing such a residence, and among these
was included in my own small morbid mind the circumstance that its back
windows commanded an uninterrupted view of an ancient and much-peopled
churchyard.&nbsp; Often of a night would I steal from between the sheets,
and climbing upon the high oak chest that stood before my bedroom window,
sit peering down fearfully upon the aged gray tombstones far below,
wondering whether the shadows that crept among them might not be ghosts&mdash;soiled
ghosts that had lost their natural whiteness by long exposure to the
city&rsquo;s smoke, and had grown dingy, like the snow that sometimes
lay there.</p>
<p>I persuaded myself that they were ghosts, and came, at length, to
have quite a friendly feeling for them.&nbsp; I wondered what they thought
when they saw the fading letters of their own names upon the stones,
whether they remembered themselves and wished they were alive again,
or whether they were happier as they were.&nbsp; But that seemed a still
sadder idea.</p>
<p>One night, as I sat there watching, I felt a hand upon my shoulder.&nbsp;
I was not frightened, because it was a soft, gentle hand that I well
knew, so I merely laid my cheek against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s mumma&rsquo;s naughty boy doing out of bed?&nbsp;
Shall I beat him?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the other hand was laid against my
other cheek, and I could feel the soft curls mingling with my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only looking at the ghosts, ma,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
such a lot of &rsquo;em down there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I added, musingly,
&ldquo;I wonder what it feels like to be a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother said nothing, but took me up in her arms, and carried me
back to bed, and then, sitting down beside me, and holding my hand in
hers&mdash;there was not so very much difference in the size&mdash;began
to sing in that low, caressing voice of hers that always made me feel,
for the time being, that I wanted to be a good boy, a song she often
used to sing to me, and that I have never heard any one else sing since,
and should not care to.</p>
<p>But while she sang, something fell on my hand that caused me to sit
up and insist on examining her eyes.&nbsp; She laughed; rather a strange,
broken little laugh, I thought, and said it was nothing, and told me
to lie still and go to sleep.&nbsp; So I wriggled down again and shut
my eyes tight, but I could not understand what had made her cry.</p>
<p>Poor little mother, she had a notion, founded evidently upon inborn
belief rather than upon observation, that all children were angels,
and that, in consequence, an altogether exceptional demand existed for
them in a certain other place, where there are more openings for angels,
rendering their retention in this world difficult and undependable.&nbsp;
My talk about ghosts must have made that foolishly fond heart ache with
a vague dread that night, and for many a night onward, I fear.</p>
<p>For some time after this I would often look up to find my mother&rsquo;s
eyes fixed upon me.&nbsp; Especially closely did she watch me at feeding
times, and on these occasions, as the meal progressed, her face would
acquire an expression of satisfaction and relief.</p>
<p>Once, during dinner, I heard her whisper to my father (for children
are not quite so deaf as their elders think), &ldquo;He seems to eat
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; replied my father in the same penetrating undertone;
&ldquo;if he dies of anything, it will be of eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So my little mother grew less troubled, and, as the days went by,
saw reason to think that my brother angels might consent to do without
me for yet a while longer; and I, putting away the child with his ghostly
fancies, became, in course of time, a grown-up person, and ceased to
believe in ghosts, together with many other things that, perhaps, it
were better for a man if he did believe in.</p>
<p>But the memory of that dingy graveyard, and of the shadows that dwelt
therein, came back to me very vividly the other day, for it seemed to
me as though I were a ghost myself, gliding through the silent streets
where once I had passed swiftly, full of life.</p>
<p>Diving into a long unopened drawer, I had, by chance, drawn forth
a dusty volume of manuscript, labelled upon its torn brown paper cover,
NOVEL NOTES.&nbsp; The scent of dead days clung to its dogs&rsquo;-eared
pages; and, as it lay open before me, my memory wandered back to the
summer evenings&mdash;not so very long ago, perhaps, if one but adds
up the years, but a long, long while ago if one measures Time by feeling&mdash;when
four friends had sat together making it, who would never sit together
any more.&nbsp; With each crumpled leaf I turned, the uncomfortable
conviction that I was only a ghost, grew stronger.&nbsp; The handwriting
was my own, but the words were the words of a stranger, so that as I
read I wondered to myself, saying: did I ever think this? did I really
hope that? did I plan to do this? did I resolve to be such? does life,
then, look so to the eyes of a young man? not knowing whether to smile
or sigh.</p>
<p>The book was a compilation, half diary, half memoranda.&nbsp; In
it lay the record of many musings, of many talks, and out of it&mdash;selecting
what seemed suitable, adding, altering, and arranging&mdash;I have shaped
the chapters that hereafter follow.</p>
<p>That I have a right to do so I have fully satisfied my own conscience,
an exceptionally fussy one.&nbsp; Of the four joint authors, he whom
I call &ldquo;MacShaughnassy&rdquo; has laid aside his title to all
things beyond six feet of sun-scorched ground in the African veldt;
while from him I have designated &ldquo;Brown&rdquo; I have borrowed
but little, and that little I may fairly claim to have made my own by
reason of the artistic merit with which I have embellished it.&nbsp;
Indeed, in thus taking a few of his bald ideas and shaping them into
readable form, am I not doing him a kindness, and thereby returning
good for evil?&nbsp; For has he not, slipping from the high ambition
of his youth, sunk ever downward step by step, until he has become a
critic, and, therefore, my natural enemy?&nbsp; Does he not, in the
columns of a certain journal of large pretension but small circulation,
call me &ldquo;&rsquo;Arry&rdquo; (without an &ldquo;H,&rdquo; the satirical
rogue), and is not his contempt for the English-speaking people based
chiefly upon the fact that some of them read my books?&nbsp; But in
the days of Bloomsbury lodgings and first-night pits we thought each
other clever.</p>
<p>From &ldquo;Jephson&rdquo; I hold a letter, dated from a station
deep in the heart of the Queensland bush.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Do what you
like with it, dear boy</i>,&rdquo; the letter runs, &ldquo;<i>so long
as you keep me out of it.&nbsp; Thanks for your complimentary regrets,
but I cannot share them.&nbsp; I was never fitted for a literary career.&nbsp;
Lucky for me, I found it out in time.&nbsp; Some poor devils don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
(I&rsquo;m not getting at you, old man.&nbsp; We read all your stuff,
and like it very much.&nbsp; Time hangs a bit heavy, you know, here,
in the winter, and we are glad of almost anything.)&nbsp; This life
suits me better.&nbsp; I love to feel my horse between my thighs, and
the sun upon my skin.&nbsp; And there are the youngsters growing up
about us, and the hands to look after, and the stock.&nbsp; I daresay
it seems a very commonplace unintellectual life to you, but it satisfies
my nature more than the writing of books could ever do.&nbsp; Besides,
there are too many authors as it is.&nbsp; The world is so busy reading
and writing, it has no time left for thinking.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll tell
me, of course, that books are thought, but that is only the jargon of
the Press.&nbsp; You come out here, old man, and sit as I do sometimes
for days and nights together alone with the dumb cattle on an upheaved
island of earth, as it were, jutting out into the deep sky, and you
will know that they are not.&nbsp; What a man thinks&mdash;really thinks&mdash;goes
down into him and grows in silence.&nbsp; What a man writes in books
are the thoughts that he wishes to be thought to think</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Jephson! he promised so well at one time.&nbsp; But he always
had strange notions.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>When, on returning home one evening, after a pipe party at my friend
Jephson&rsquo;s, I informed my wife that I was going to write a novel,
she expressed herself as pleased with the idea.&nbsp; She said she had
often wondered I had never thought of doing so before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;how silly all the novels are nowadays; I&rsquo;m sure
you could write one.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ethelbertha intended to be complimentary,
I am convinced; but there is a looseness about her mode of expression
which, at times, renders her meaning obscure.)</p>
<p>When, however, I told her that my friend Jephson was going to collaborate
with me, she remarked, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; in a doubtful tone; and when
I further went on to explain to her that Selkirk Brown and Derrick MacShaughnassy
were also going to assist, she replied, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; in a tone
which contained no trace of doubtfulness whatever, and from which it
was clear that her interest in the matter, as a practical scheme, had
entirely evaporated.</p>
<p>I fancy that the fact of my three collaborators being all bachelors
diminished somewhat our chances of success, in Ethelbertha&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;
Against bachelors, as a class, she entertains a strong prejudice.&nbsp;
A man&rsquo;s not having sense enough to want to marry, or, having that,
not having wit enough to do it, argues to her thinking either weakness
of intellect or natural depravity, the former rendering its victim unable,
and the latter unfit, ever to become a really useful novelist.</p>
<p>I tried to make her understand the peculiar advantages our plan possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;in the usual commonplace
novel we only get, as a matter of fact, one person&rsquo;s ideas.&nbsp;
Now, in this novel, there will be four clever men all working together.&nbsp;
The public will thus be enabled to obtain the thoughts and opinions
of the whole four of us, at the price usually asked for merely one author&rsquo;s
views.&nbsp; If the British reader knows his own business, he will order
this book early, to avoid disappointment.&nbsp; Such an opportunity
may not occur again for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethelbertha agreed that this was probable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; I continued, my enthusiasm waxing stronger
the more I reflected upon the matter, &ldquo;this work is going to be
a genuine bargain in another way also.&nbsp; We are not going to put
our mere everyday ideas into it.&nbsp; We are going to crowd into this
one novel all the wit and wisdom that the whole four of us possess,
if the book will hold it.&nbsp; We shall not write another novel after
this one.&nbsp; Indeed, we shall not be able to; we shall have nothing
more to write.&nbsp; This work will partake of the nature of an intellectual
clearance sale.&nbsp; We are going to put into this novel simply all
we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethelbertha shut her lips, and said something inside; and then remarked
aloud that she supposed it would be a one volume affair.</p>
<p>I felt hurt at the implied sneer.&nbsp; I pointed out to her that
there already existed a numerous body of specially-trained men employed
to do nothing else but make disagreeable observations upon authors and
their works&mdash;a duty that, so far as I could judge, they seemed
capable of performing without any amateur assistance whatever.&nbsp;
And I hinted that, by his own fireside, a literary man looked to breathe
a more sympathetic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Ethelbertha replied that of course I knew what she meant.&nbsp; She
said that she was not thinking of me, and that Jephson was, no doubt,
sensible enough (Jephson is engaged), but she did not see the object
of bringing half the parish into it.&nbsp; (Nobody suggested bringing
&ldquo;half the parish&rdquo; into it.&nbsp; Ethelbertha will talk so
wildly.)&nbsp; To suppose that Brown and MacShaughnassy could be of
any use whatever, she considered absurd.&nbsp; What could a couple of
raw bachelors know about life and human nature?&nbsp; As regarded MacShaughnassy
in particular, she was of opinion that if we only wanted out of him
all that <i>he</i> knew, and could keep him to the subject, we ought
to be able to get that into about a page.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s present estimate of MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s knowledge
is the result of reaction.&nbsp; The first time she ever saw him, she
and he got on wonderfully well together; and when I returned to the
drawing-room, after seeing him down to the gate, her first words were,
&ldquo;What a wonderful man that Mr. MacShaughnassy is.&nbsp; He seems
to know so much about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That describes MacShaughnassy exactly.&nbsp; He does seem to know
a tremendous lot.&nbsp; He is possessed of more information than any
man I ever came across.&nbsp; Occasionally, it is correct information;
but, speaking broadly, it is remarkable for its marvellous unreliability.&nbsp;
Where he gets it from is a secret that nobody has ever yet been able
to fathom.</p>
<p>Ethelbertha was very young when we started housekeeping.&nbsp; (Our
first butcher very nearly lost her custom, I remember, once and for
ever by calling her &ldquo;Missie,&rdquo; and giving her a message to
take back to her mother.&nbsp; She arrived home in tears.&nbsp; She
said that perhaps she wasn&rsquo;t fit to be anybody&rsquo;s wife, but
she did not see why she should be told so by the tradespeople.)&nbsp;
She was naturally somewhat inexperienced in domestic affairs, and, feeling
this keenly, was grateful to any one who would give her useful hints
and advice.&nbsp; When MacShaughnassy came along he seemed, in her eyes,
a sort of glorified Mrs. Beeton.&nbsp; He knew everything wanted to
be known inside a house, from the scientific method of peeling a potato
to the cure of spasms in cats, and Ethelbertha would sit at his feet,
figuratively speaking, and gain enough information in one evening to
make the house unlivable in for a month.</p>
<p>He told her how fires ought to be laid.&nbsp; He said that the way
fires were usually laid in this country was contrary to all the laws
of nature, and he showed her how the thing was done in Crim Tartary,
or some such place, where the science of laying fires is alone properly
understood.&nbsp; He proved to her that an immense saving in time and
labour, to say nothing of coals, could be effected by the adoption of
the Crim Tartary system; and he taught it to her then and there, and
she went straight downstairs and explained it to the girl.</p>
<p>Amenda, our then &ldquo;general,&rdquo; was an extremely stolid young
person, and, in some respects, a model servant.&nbsp; She never argued.&nbsp;
She never seemed to have any notions of her own whatever.&nbsp; She
accepted our ideas without comment, and carried them out with such pedantic
precision and such evident absence of all feeling of responsibility
concerning the result as to surround our home legislation with quite
a military atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the present occasion she stood quietly by while the MacShaughnassy
method of fire-laying was expounded to her.&nbsp; When Ethelbertha had
finished she simply said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to lay the fires like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Amenda, we&rsquo;ll always have the fires laid like that
in future, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, mum,&rdquo; replied Amenda, with perfect unconcern,
and there the matter ended, for that evening.</p>
<p>On coming downstairs the next morning we found the breakfast table
spread very nicely, but there was no breakfast.&nbsp; We waited.&nbsp;
Ten minutes went by&mdash;a quarter of an hour&mdash;twenty minutes.&nbsp;
Then Ethelbertha rang the bell.&nbsp; In response Amenda presented herself,
calm and respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that the proper time for breakfast is half-past
eight, Amenda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know that it&rsquo;s now nearly nine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t breakfast ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it <i>ever</i> be ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mum,&rdquo; replied Amenda, in a tone of genial frankness,
&ldquo;to tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t think it ever will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t the fire light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it lights all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why can&rsquo;t you cook the breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because before you can turn yourself round it goes out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amenda never volunteered statements.&nbsp; She answered the question
put to her and then stopped dead.&nbsp; I called downstairs to her on
one occasion, before I understood her peculiarities, to ask her if she
knew the time.&nbsp; She replied, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and disappeared
into the back kitchen.&nbsp; At the end of thirty seconds or so, I called
down again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked you, Amenda,&rdquo; I said reproachfully,
&ldquo;to tell me the time about ten minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you?&rdquo; she called back pleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
beg your pardon.&nbsp; I thought you asked me if I knew it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
half-past four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethelbertha inquired&mdash;to return to our fire&mdash;if she had
tried lighting it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, mum,&rdquo; answered the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
tried four times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she added cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try again if you like, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amenda was the most willing servant we ever paid wages to.</p>
<p>Ethelbertha said she would step down and light the fire herself,
and told Amenda to follow her and watch how she did it.&nbsp; I felt
interested in the experiment, and followed also.&nbsp; Ethelbertha tucked
up her frock and set to work.&nbsp; Amenda and I stood around and looked
on.</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour Ethelbertha retired from the contest,
hot, dirty, and a trifle irritable.&nbsp; The fireplace retained the
same cold, cynical expression with which it had greeted our entrance.</p>
<p>Then I tried.&nbsp; I honestly tried my best.&nbsp; I was eager and
anxious to succeed.&nbsp; For one reason, I wanted my breakfast.&nbsp;
For another, I wanted to be able to say that I had done this thing.&nbsp;
It seemed to me that for any human being to light a fire, laid as that
fire was laid, would be a feat to be proud of.&nbsp; To light a fire
even under ordinary circumstances is not too easy a task: to do so,
handicapped by MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s rules, would, I felt, be an achievement
pleasant to look back upon.&nbsp; My idea, had I succeeded, would have
been to go round the neighbourhood and brag about it.</p>
<p>However, I did not succeed.&nbsp; I lit various other things, including
the kitchen carpet and the cat, who would come sniffing about, but the
materials within the stove appeared to be fire-proof.</p>
<p>Ethelbertha and I sat down, one each side of our cheerless hearth,
and looked at one another, and thought of MacShaughnassy, until Amenda
chimed in on our despair with one of those practical suggestions of
hers that she occasionally threw out for us to accept or not, as we
chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better light it in
the old way just for to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, Amenda,&rdquo; said Ethelbertha, rising.&nbsp; And then
she added, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll always have them lighted in the
old way, Amenda, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time he showed us how to make coffee&mdash;according to the
Arabian method.&nbsp; Arabia must be a very untidy country if they made
coffee often over there.&nbsp; He dirtied two saucepans, three jugs,
one tablecloth, one nutmeg-grater, one hearthrug, three cups, and himself.&nbsp;
This made coffee for two&mdash;what would have been necessary in the
case of a party, one dares not think.</p>
<p>That we did not like the coffee when made, MacShaughnassy attributed
to our debased taste&mdash;the result of long indulgence in an inferior
article.&nbsp; He drank both cups himself, and afterwards went home
in a cab.</p>
<p>He had an aunt in those days, I remember, a mysterious old lady,
who lived in some secluded retreat from where she wrought incalculable
mischief upon MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; What he did not
know&mdash;the one or two things that he was <i>not</i> an authority
upon&mdash;this aunt of his knew.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he would say
with engaging candour&mdash;&ldquo;no, that is a thing I cannot advise
you about myself.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he would add, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what I&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write to my aunt and ask
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a day or two afterwards he would call again, bringing
his aunt&rsquo;s advice with him; and, if you were young and inexperienced,
or a natural born fool, you might possibly follow it.</p>
<p>She sent us a recipe on one occasion, through MacShaughnassy, for
the extermination of blackbeetles.&nbsp; We occupied a very picturesque
old house; but, as with most picturesque old houses, its advantages
were chiefly external.&nbsp; There were many holes and cracks and crevices
within its creaking framework.&nbsp; Frogs, who had lost their way and
taken the wrong turning, would suddenly discover themselves in the middle
of our dining-room, apparently quite as much to their own surprise and
annoyance as to ours.&nbsp; A numerous company of rats and mice, remarkably
fond of physical exercise, had fitted the place up as a gymnasium for
themselves; and our kitchen, after ten o&rsquo;clock, was turned into
a blackbeetles&rsquo; club.&nbsp; They came up through the floor and
out through the walls, and gambolled there in their light-hearted, reckless
way till daylight.</p>
<p>The rats and mice Amenda did not object to.&nbsp; She said she liked
to watch them.&nbsp; But against the blackbeetles she was prejudiced.&nbsp;
Therefore, when my wife informed her that MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s aunt
had given us an infallible recipe for their annihilation, she rejoiced.</p>
<p>We purchased the materials, manufactured the mixture, and put it
about.&nbsp; The beetles came and ate it.&nbsp; They seemed to like
it.&nbsp; They finished it all up, and were evidently vexed that there
was not more.&nbsp; But they did not die.</p>
<p>We told these facts to MacShaughnassy.&nbsp; He smiled, a very grim
smile, and said in a low tone, full of meaning, &ldquo;Let them eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that this was one of those slow, insidious poisons.&nbsp;
It did not kill the beetle off immediately, but it undermined his constitution.&nbsp;
Day by day he would sink and droop without being able to tell what was
the matter with himself, until one morning we should enter the kitchen
to find him lying cold and very still.</p>
<p>So we made more stuff and laid it round each night, and the blackbeetles
from all about the parish swarmed to it.&nbsp; Each night they came
in greater quantities.&nbsp; They fetched up all their friends and relations.&nbsp;
Strange beetles&mdash;beetles from other families, with no claim on
us whatever&mdash;got to hear about the thing, and came in hordes, and
tried to rob our blackbeetles of it.&nbsp; By the end of a week we had
lured into our kitchen every beetle that wasn&rsquo;t lame for miles
round.</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy said it was a good thing.&nbsp; We should clear the
suburb at one swoop.&nbsp; The beetles had now been eating this poison
steadily for ten days, and he said that the end could not be far off.&nbsp;
I was glad to hear it, because I was beginning to find this unlimited
hospitality expensive.&nbsp; It was a dear poison that we were giving
them, and they were hearty eaters.</p>
<p>We went downstairs to see how they were getting on.&nbsp; MacShaughnassy
thought they seemed queer, and was of opinion that they were breaking
up.&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I can only say that a healthier-looking
lot of beetles I never wish to see.</p>
<p>One, it is true, did die that very evening.&nbsp; He was detected
in the act of trying to make off with an unfairly large portion of the
poison, and three or four of the others set upon him savagely and killed
him.</p>
<p>But he was the only one, so far as I could ever discover, to whom
MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s recipe proved fatal.&nbsp; As for the others,
they grew fat and sleek upon it.&nbsp; Some of them, indeed, began to
acquire quite a figure.&nbsp; We lessened their numbers eventually by
the help of some common oil-shop stuff.&nbsp; But such vast numbers,
attracted by MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s poison, had settled in the house,
that to finally exterminate them now was hopeless.</p>
<p>I have not heard of MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s aunt lately.&nbsp; Possibly,
one of MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s bosom friends has found out her address
and has gone down and murdered her.&nbsp; If so, I should like to thank
him.</p>
<p>I tried a little while ago to cure MacShaughnassy of his fatal passion
for advice-giving, by repeating to him a very sad story that was told
to me by a gentleman I met in an American railway car.&nbsp; I was travelling
from Buffalo to New York, and, during the day, it suddenly occurred
to me that I might make the journey more interesting by leaving the
cars at Albany and completing the distance by water.&nbsp; But I did
not know how the boats ran, and I had no guide-book with me.&nbsp; I
glanced about for some one to question.&nbsp; A mild-looking, elderly
gentleman sat by the next window reading a book, the cover of which
was familiar to me.&nbsp; I deemed him to be intelligent, and approached
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon for interrupting you,&rdquo; I said, sitting
down opposite to him, &ldquo;but could you give me any information about
the boats between Albany and New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, looking up with a pleasant smile,
&ldquo;there are three lines of boats altogether.&nbsp; There is the
Heggarty line, but they only go as far as Catskill.&nbsp; Then there
are the Poughkeepsie boats, which go every other day.&nbsp; Or there
is what we call the canal boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well now, which would you
advise me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet with a cry, and stood glaring down at me with
a gleam in his eyes which was positively murderous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; he hissed in low tones of concentrated
fury, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s your game, is it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give
you something that you&rsquo;ll want advice about,&rdquo; and he whipped
out a six-chambered revolver.</p>
<p>I felt hurt.&nbsp; I also felt that if the interview were prolonged
I might feel even more hurt.&nbsp; So I left him without a word, and
drifted over to the other end of the car, where I took up a position
between a stout lady and the door.</p>
<p>I was still musing upon the incident, when, looking up, I observed
my elderly friend making towards me.&nbsp; I rose and laid my hand upon
the door-knob.&nbsp; He should not find me unprepared.&nbsp; He smiled,
reassuringly, however, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that maybe
I was a little rude just now.&nbsp; I should like, if you will let me,
to explain.&nbsp; I think, when you have heard my story, you will understand,
and forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was that about him which made me trust him.&nbsp; We found
a quiet corner in the smoking-car.&nbsp; I had a &ldquo;whiskey sour,&rdquo;
and he prescribed for himself a strange thing of his own invention.&nbsp;
Then we lighted our cigars, and he talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty years ago,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was a young man
with a healthy belief in myself, and a desire to do good to others.&nbsp;
I did not imagine myself a genius.&nbsp; I did not even consider myself
exceptionally brilliant or talented.&nbsp; But it did seem to me, and
the more I noted the doings of my fellow-men and women, the more assured
did I become of it, that I possessed plain, practical common sense to
an unusual and remarkable degree.&nbsp; Conscious of this, I wrote a
little book, which I entitled <i>How to be Happy, Wealthy, and Wise</i>,
and published it at my own expense.&nbsp; I did not seek for profit.&nbsp;
I merely wished to be useful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book did not make the stir that I had anticipated.&nbsp;
Some two or three hundred copies went off, and then the sale practically
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess that at first I was disappointed.&nbsp; But after
a while, I reflected that, if people would not take my advice, it was
more their loss than mine, and I dismissed the matter from my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning, about a twelvemonth afterwards, I was sitting
in my study, when the servant entered to say that there was a man downstairs
who wanted very much to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave instructions that he should be sent up, and up accordingly
he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a common man, but he had an open, intelligent countenance,
and his manner was most respectful.&nbsp; I motioned him to be seated.&nbsp;
He selected a chair, and sat down on the extreme edge of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll pard&rsquo;n this intrusion, sir,&rsquo;
he began, speaking deliberately, and twirling his hat the while; &lsquo;but
I&rsquo;ve come more&rsquo;n two hundred miles to see you, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expressed myself as pleased, and he continued: &lsquo;They
tell me, sir, as you&rsquo;re the gentleman as wrote that little book,
<i>How to be Happy, Wealthy, and Wise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He enumerated the three items slowly, dwelling lovingly on each.&nbsp;
I admitted the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a wonderful book, sir,&rsquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t one of them as has got brains of their
own&mdash;not to speak of&mdash;but I know enough to know them as has;
and when I read that little book, I says to myself, Josiah Hackett (that&rsquo;s
my name, sir), when you&rsquo;re in doubt don&rsquo;t you get addling
that thick head o&rsquo; yours, as will only tell you all wrong; you
go to the gentleman as wrote that little book and ask him for his advice.&nbsp;
He is a kind-hearted gentleman, as any one can tell, and he&rsquo;ll
give it you; and <i>when</i> you&rsquo;ve got it, you go straight ahead,
full steam, and don&rsquo;t you stop for nothing, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;ll
know what&rsquo;s best for you, same as he knows what&rsquo;s best for
everybody.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I says, sir; and that&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;m here for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He paused, and wiped his brow with a green cotton handkerchief.&nbsp;
I prayed him to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appeared that the worthy fellow wanted to marry, but could
not make up his mind <i>whom</i> he wanted to marry.&nbsp; He had his
eye&mdash;so he expressed it&mdash;upon two young women, and they, he
had reason to believe, regarded him in return with more than usual favour.&nbsp;
His difficulty was to decide which of the two&mdash;both of them excellent
and deserving young persons&mdash;would make him the best wife.&nbsp;
The one, Juliana, the only daughter of a retired sea-captain, he described
as a winsome lassie.&nbsp; The other, Hannah, was an older and altogether
more womanly girl.&nbsp; She was the eldest of a large family.&nbsp;
Her father, he said, was a God-fearing man, and was doing well in the
timber trade.&nbsp; He asked me which of them I should advise him to
marry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was flattered.&nbsp; What man in my position would not have
been?&nbsp; This Josiah Hackett had come from afar to hear my wisdom.&nbsp;
He was willing&mdash;nay, anxious&mdash;to entrust his whole life&rsquo;s
happiness to my discretion.&nbsp; That he was wise in so doing, I entertained
no doubt.&nbsp; The choice of a wife I had always held to be a matter
needing a calm, unbiassed judgment, such as no lover could possibly
bring to bear upon the subject.&nbsp; In such a case, I should not have
hesitated to offer advice to the wisest of men.&nbsp; To this poor,
simple-minded fellow, I felt it would be cruel to refuse it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He handed me photographs of both the young persons under consideration.&nbsp;
I jotted down on the back of each such particulars as I deemed would
assist me in estimating their respective fitness for the vacancy in
question, and promised to carefully consider the problem, and write
him in a day or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His gratitude was touching.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble
to write no letters, sir,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you just stick down
&ldquo;Julia&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hannah&rdquo; on a bit of paper, and put
it in an envelope.&nbsp; I shall know what it means, and that&rsquo;s
the one as I shall marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he gripped me by the hand and left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave a good deal of thought to the selection of Josiah&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; I wanted him to be happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juliana was certainly very pretty.&nbsp; There was a lurking
playfulness about the corners of Juliana&rsquo;s mouth which conjured
up the sound of rippling laughter.&nbsp; Had I acted on impulse, I should
have clasped Juliana in Josiah&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I reflected, more sterling qualities than mere playfulness
and prettiness are needed for a wife.&nbsp; Hannah, though not so charming,
clearly possessed both energy and sense&mdash;qualities highly necessary
to a poor man&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Hannah&rsquo;s father was a pious
man, and was &lsquo;doing well&rsquo;&mdash;a thrifty, saving man, no
doubt.&nbsp; He would have instilled into her lessons of economy and
virtue; and, later on, she might possibly come in for a little something.&nbsp;
She was the eldest of a large family.&nbsp; She was sure to have had
to help her mother a good deal.&nbsp; She would be experienced in household
matters, and would understand the bringing up of children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia&rsquo;s father, on the other hand, was a retired sea-captain.&nbsp;
Seafaring folk are generally loose sort of fish.&nbsp; He had probably
been in the habit of going about the house, using language and expressing
views, the hearing of which could not but have exercised an injurious
effect upon the formation of a growing girl&rsquo;s character.&nbsp;
Juliana was his only child.&nbsp; Only children generally make bad men
and women.&nbsp; They are allowed to have their own way too much.&nbsp;
The pretty daughter of a retired sea-captain would be certain to be
spoilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, I had also to remember, was a man evidently of weak
character.&nbsp; He would need management.&nbsp; Now, there was something
about Hannah&rsquo;s eye that eminently suggested management.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of two days my mind was made up.&nbsp; I wrote
&lsquo;Hannah&rsquo; on a slip of paper, and posted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortnight afterwards I received a letter from Josiah.&nbsp;
He thanked me for my advice, but added, incidentally, that he wished
I could have made it Julia.&nbsp; However, he said, he felt sure I knew
best, and by the time I received the letter he and Hannah would be one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That letter worried me.&nbsp; I began to wonder if, after
all, I had chosen the right girl.&nbsp; Suppose Hannah was not all I
thought her!&nbsp; What a terrible thing it would be for Josiah.&nbsp;
What data, sufficient to reason upon, had I possessed?&nbsp; How did
I know that Hannah was not a lazy, ill-tempered girl, a continual thorn
in the side of her poor, overworked mother, and a perpetual blister
to her younger brothers and sisters?&nbsp; How did I know she had been
well brought up?&nbsp; Her father might be a precious old fraud: most
seemingly pious men are.&nbsp; She may have learned from him only hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then also, how did I know that Juliana&rsquo;s merry childishness
would not ripen into sweet, cheerful womanliness?&nbsp; Her father,
for all I knew to the contrary, might be the model of what a retired
sea-captain should be; with possibly a snug little sum safely invested
somewhere.&nbsp; And Juliana was his only child.&nbsp; What reason had
I for rejecting this fair young creature&rsquo;s love for Josiah?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took her photo from my desk.&nbsp; I seemed to detect a
reproachful look in the big eyes.&nbsp; I saw before me the scene in
the little far-away home when the first tidings of Josiah&rsquo;s marriage
fell like a cruel stone into the hitherto placid waters of her life.&nbsp;
I saw her kneeling by her father&rsquo;s chair, while the white-haired,
bronzed old man gently stroked the golden head, shaking with silent
sobs against his breast.&nbsp; My remorse was almost more than I could
bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put her aside and took up Hannah&mdash;my chosen one.&nbsp;
She seemed to be regarding me with a smile of heartless triumph.&nbsp;
There began to take possession of me a feeling of positive dislike to
Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fought against the feeling.&nbsp; I told myself it was prejudice.&nbsp;
But the more I reasoned against it the stronger it became.&nbsp; I could
tell that, as the days went by, it would grow from dislike to loathing,
from loathing to hate.&nbsp; And this was the woman I had deliberately
selected as a life companion for Josiah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For weeks I knew no peace of mind.&nbsp; Every letter that
arrived I dreaded to open, fearing it might be from Josiah.&nbsp; At
every knock I started up, and looked about for a hiding-place.&nbsp;
Every time I came across the heading, &lsquo;Domestic Tragedy,&rsquo;
in the newspapers, I broke into a cold perspiration.&nbsp; I expected
to read that Josiah and Hannah had murdered each other, and died cursing
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the time went by, however, and I heard nothing, my fears
began to assuage, and my belief in my own intuitive good judgment to
return.&nbsp; Maybe, I had done a good thing for Josiah and Hannah,
and they were blessing me.&nbsp; Three years passed peacefully away,
and I was beginning to forget the existence of the Hacketts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he came again.&nbsp; I returned home from business one
evening to find him waiting for me in the hall.&nbsp; The moment I saw
him I knew that my worst fears had fallen short of the truth.&nbsp;
I motioned him to follow me to my study.&nbsp; He did so, and seated
himself in the identical chair on which he had sat three years ago.&nbsp;
The change in him was remarkable; he looked old and careworn.&nbsp;
His manner was that of resigned hopelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remained for a while without speaking, he twirling his
hat as at our first interview, I making a show of arranging papers on
my desk.&nbsp; At length, feeling that anything would be more bearable
than this silence, I turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Things have not been going well with you, I&rsquo;m
afraid, Josiah?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; he replied quietly; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
say as they have, altogether.&nbsp; That Hannah of yours has turned
out a bit of a teaser.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no touch of reproach in his tones.&nbsp; He simply
stated a melancholy fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But she is a good wife to you in other ways,&rsquo;
I urged.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has her faults, of course.&nbsp; We all have.&nbsp;
But she is energetic.&nbsp; Come now, you will admit she&rsquo;s energetic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owed it to myself to find some good in Hannah, and this
was the only thing I could think of at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes, she&rsquo;s that,&rsquo; he assented.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A little too much so for our sized house, I sometimes think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a bit
cornery in her temper, Hannah is; and then her mother&rsquo;s a bit
trying, at times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Her mother!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;but what&rsquo;s
<i>she</i> got to do with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you see, sir,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s
living with us now&mdash;ever since the old man went off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hannah&rsquo;s father!&nbsp; Is he dead, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, not exactly, sir,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
ran off about a twelvemonth ago with one of the young women who used
to teach in the Sunday School, and joined the Mormons.&nbsp; It came
as a great surprise to every one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I groaned.&nbsp; &lsquo;And his business,&rsquo; I inquired&mdash;&lsquo;the
timber business, who carries that on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, that!&rsquo; answered Josiah.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
that had to be sold to pay his debts&mdash;leastways, to go towards
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remarked what a terrible thing it was for his family.&nbsp;
I supposed the home was broken up, and they were all scattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; he replied simply, &lsquo;they ain&rsquo;t
scattered much.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all living with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there,&rsquo; he continued, seeing the look upon
my face; &lsquo;of course, all this has nothing to do with you sir.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got troubles of your own, I daresay, sir.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
come here to worry you with mine.&nbsp; That would be a poor return
for all your kindness to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What has become of Julia?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; I did
not feel I wanted to question him any more about his own affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A smile broke the settled melancholy of his features.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he said, in a more cheerful tone than he had hitherto
employed, &lsquo;it does one good to think about <i>her</i>, it does.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s married to a friend of mine now, young Sam Jessop.&nbsp;
I slips out and gives &rsquo;em a call now and then, when Hannah ain&rsquo;t
round.&nbsp; Lord, it&rsquo;s like getting a glimpse of heaven to look
into their little home.&nbsp; He often chaffs me about it, Sam does.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, you <i>was</i> a sawny-headed chunk, Josiah, <i>you</i>
was,&rdquo; he often says to me.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re old chums, you know,
sir, Sam and me, so he don&rsquo;t mind joking a bit like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the smile died away, and he added with a sigh, &lsquo;Yes,
I&rsquo;ve often thought since, sir, how jolly it would have been if
you could have seen your way to making it Juliana.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt I must get him back to Hannah at any cost.&nbsp; I
said, &lsquo;I suppose you and your wife are still living in the old
place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;if you can call it living.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a hard struggle with so many of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he did not know how he should have managed if it had
not been for the help of Julia&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; He said the captain
had behaved more like an angel than anything else he knew of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say as he&rsquo;s one of your clever
sort, you know, sir,&rsquo; he explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not the man as
one would go to for advice, like one would to you, sir; but he&rsquo;s
a good sort for all that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And that reminds me, sir,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;of
what I&rsquo;ve come here about.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll think it very bold
of me to ask, sir, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I interrupted him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Josiah,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I
admit that I am much to blame for what has come upon you.&nbsp; You
asked me for my advice, and I gave it you.&nbsp; Which of us was the
bigger idiot, we will not discuss.&nbsp; The point is that I did give
it, and I am not a man to shirk my responsibilities.&nbsp; What, in
reason, you ask, and I can grant, I will give you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was overcome with gratitude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew it, sir,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew you would not refuse me.&nbsp; I said so
to Hannah.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I will go to that gentleman and ask
him.&nbsp; I will go to him and ask him for his advice.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;His what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His advice,&rsquo; repeated Josiah, apparently surprised
at my tone, &lsquo;on a little matter as I can&rsquo;t quite make up
my mind about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought at first he was trying to be sarcastic, but he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
That man sat there, and wrestled with me for my advice as to whether
he should invest a thousand dollars which Julia&rsquo;s father had offered
to lend him, in the purchase of a laundry business or a bar.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t had enough of it (my advice, I mean); he wanted it again,
and he spun me reasons why I should give it him.&nbsp; The choice of
a wife was a different thing altogether, he argued.&nbsp; Perhaps he
ought <i>not</i> to have asked me for my opinion as to that.&nbsp; But
advice as to which of two trades a man would do best to select, surely
any business man could give.&nbsp; He said he had just been reading
again my little book, <i>How to be Happy</i>, etc., and if the gentleman
who wrote that could not decide between the respective merits of one
particular laundry and one particular bar, both situate in the same
city, well, then, all he had got to say was that knowledge and wisdom
were clearly of no practical use in this world whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did seem a simple thing to advise a man about.&nbsp;
Surely as to a matter of this kind, I, a professed business man, must
be able to form a sounder judgment than this poor pumpkin-headed lamb.&nbsp;
It would be heartless to refuse to help him.&nbsp; I promised to look
into the matter, and let him know what I thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose and shook me by the hand.&nbsp; He said he would not
try to thank me; words would only seem weak.&nbsp; He dashed away a
tear and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought an amount of thought to bear upon this thousand-dollar
investment sufficient to have floated a bank.&nbsp; I did not mean to
make another Hannah job, if I could help it.&nbsp; I studied the papers
Josiah had left with me, but did not attempt to form any opinion from
them.&nbsp; I went down quietly to Josiah&rsquo;s city, and inspected
both businesses on the spot.&nbsp; I instituted secret but searching
inquiries in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I disguised myself as a simple-minded
young man who had come into a little money, and wormed myself into the
confidence of the servants.&nbsp; I interviewed half the town upon the
pretence that I was writing the commercial history of New England, and
should like some particulars of their career, and I invariably ended
my examination by asking them which was their favourite bar, and where
they got their washing done.&nbsp; I stayed a fortnight in the town.&nbsp;
Most of my spare time I spent at the bar.&nbsp; In my leisure moments
I dirtied my clothes so that they might be washed at the laundry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the result of my investigations I discovered that, so far
as the two businesses themselves were concerned, there was not a pin
to choose between them.&nbsp; It became merely a question of which particular
trade would best suit the Hacketts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reflected.&nbsp; The keeper of a bar was exposed to much
temptation.&nbsp; A weak-minded man, mingling continually in the company
of topers, might possibly end by giving way to drink.&nbsp; Now, Josiah
was an exceptionally weak-minded man.&nbsp; It had also to be borne
in mind that he had a shrewish wife, and that her whole family had come
to live with him.&nbsp; Clearly, to place Josiah in a position of easy
access to unlimited liquor would be madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a laundry, on the other hand, there was something soothing.&nbsp;
The working of a laundry needed many hands.&nbsp; Hannah&rsquo;s relatives
might be used up in a laundry, and made to earn their own living.&nbsp;
Hannah might expend her energy in flat-ironing, and Josiah could turn
the mangle.&nbsp; The idea conjured up quite a pleasant domestic picture.&nbsp;
I recommended the laundry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following Monday, Josiah wrote to say that he had bought
the laundry.&nbsp; On Tuesday I read in the <i>Commercial Intelligence</i>
that one of the most remarkable features of the time was the marvellous
rise taking place all over New England in the value of hotel and bar
property.&nbsp; On Thursday, in the list of failures, I came across
no less than four laundry proprietors; and the paper added, in explanation,
that the American washing industry, owing to the rapid growth of Chinese
competition, was practically on its last legs.&nbsp; I went out and
got drunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life became a curse to me.&nbsp; All day long I thought
of Josiah.&nbsp; All night I dreamed of him.&nbsp; Suppose that, not
content with being the cause of his domestic misery, I had now deprived
him of the means of earning a livelihood, and had rendered useless the
generosity of that good old sea-captain.&nbsp; I began to appear to
myself as a malignant fiend, ever following this simple but worthy man
to work evil upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time passed away, however; I heard nothing from or of him,
and my burden at last fell from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then at the end of about five years he came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came behind me as I was opening the door with my latch-key,
and laid an unsteady hand upon my arm.&nbsp; It was a dark night, but
a gas-lamp showed me his face.&nbsp; I recognised it in spite of the
red blotches and the bleary film that hid the eyes.&nbsp; I caught him
roughly by the arm, and hurried him inside and up into my study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; I hissed, &lsquo;and tell me the worst
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was about to select his favourite chair.&nbsp; I felt that
if I saw him and that particular chair in association for the third
time, I should do something terrible to both.&nbsp; I snatched it away
from him, and he sat down heavily on the floor, and burst into tears.&nbsp;
I let him remain there, and, thickly, between hiccoughs, he told his
tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The laundry had gone from bad to worse.&nbsp; A new railway
had come to the town, altering its whole topography.&nbsp; The business
and residential portion had gradually shifted northward.&nbsp; The spot
where the bar&mdash;the particular one which I had rejected for the
laundry&mdash;had formerly stood was now the commercial centre of the
city.&nbsp; The man who had purchased it in place of Josiah had sold
out and made a fortune.&nbsp; The southern area (where the laundry was
situate) was, it had been discovered, built upon a swamp, and was in
a highly unsanitary condition.&nbsp; Careful housewives naturally objected
to sending their washing into such a neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other troubles had also come.&nbsp; The baby&mdash;Josiah&rsquo;s
pet, the one bright thing in his life&mdash;had fallen into the copper
and been boiled.&nbsp; Hannah&rsquo;s mother had been crushed in the
mangle, and was now a helpless cripple, who had to be waited on day
and night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under these accumulated misfortunes Josiah had sought consolation
in drink, and had become a hopeless sot.&nbsp; He felt his degradation
keenly, and wept copiously.&nbsp; He said he thought that in a cheerful
place, such as a bar, he might have been strong and brave; but that
there was something about the everlasting smell of damp clothes and
suds, that seemed to sap his manhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him what the captain had said to it all.&nbsp; He
burst into fresh tears, and replied that the captain was no more.&nbsp;
That, he added, reminded him of what he had come about.&nbsp; The good-hearted
old fellow had bequeathed him five thousand dollars.&nbsp; He wanted
my advice as to how to invest it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first impulse was to kill him on the spot.&nbsp; I wish
now that I had.&nbsp; I restrained myself, however, and offered him
the alternative of being thrown from the window or of leaving by the
door without another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He answered that he was quite prepared to go by the window
if I would first tell him whether to put his money in the Terra del
Fuego Nitrate Company, Limited, or in the Union Pacific Bank.&nbsp;
Life had no further interest for him.&nbsp; All he cared for was to
feel that this little nest-egg was safely laid by for the benefit of
his beloved ones after he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pressed me to tell him what I thought of nitrates.&nbsp;
I replied that I declined to say anything whatever on the subject.&nbsp;
He assumed from my answer that I did not think much of nitrates, and
announced his intention of investing the money, in consequence, in the
Union Pacific Bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him by all means to do so, if he liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He paused, and seemed to be puzzling it out.&nbsp; Then he
smiled knowingly, and said he thought he understood what I meant.&nbsp;
It was very kind of me.&nbsp; He should put every dollar he possessed
in the Terra del Fuego Nitrate Company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose (with difficulty) to go.&nbsp; I stopped him.&nbsp;
I knew, as certainly as I knew the sun would rise the next morning,
that whichever company I advised him, or he persisted in thinking I
had advised him (which was the same thing), to invest in, would, sooner
or later, come to smash.&nbsp; My grandmother had all her little fortune
in the Terra del Fuego Nitrate Company.&nbsp; I could not see her brought
to penury in her old age.&nbsp; As for Josiah, it could make no difference
to him whatever.&nbsp; He would lose his money in any event.&nbsp; I
advised him to invest in Union Pacific Bank Shares.&nbsp; He went and
did it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Union Pacific Bank held out for eighteen months.&nbsp;
Then it began to totter.&nbsp; The financial world stood bewildered.&nbsp;
It had always been reckoned one of the safest banks in the country.&nbsp;
People asked what could be the cause.&nbsp; I knew well enough, but
I did not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bank made a gallant fight, but the hand of fate was upon
it.&nbsp; At the end of another nine months the crash came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Nitrates, it need hardly be said, had all this time been
going up by leaps and bounds.&nbsp; My grandmother died worth a million
dollars, and left the whole of it to a charity.&nbsp; Had she known
how I had saved her from ruin, she might have been more grateful.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days after the failure of the Bank, Josiah arrived on
my doorstep; and, this time, he brought his families with him.&nbsp;
There were sixteen of them in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was I to do?&nbsp; I had brought these people step by
step to the verge of starvation.&nbsp; I had laid waste alike their
happiness and their prospects in life.&nbsp; The least amends I could
make was to see that at all events they did not want for the necessities
of existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was seventeen years ago.&nbsp; I am still seeing that
they do not want for the necessities of existence; and my conscience
is growing easier by noticing that they seem contented with their lot.&nbsp;
There are twenty-two of them now, and we have hopes of another in the
spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my story,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you
will now understand my sudden emotion when you asked for my advice.&nbsp;
As a matter of fact, I do not give advice now on any subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>I told this tale to MacShaughnassy.&nbsp; He agreed with me that
it was instructive, and said he should remember it.&nbsp; He said he
should remember it so as to tell it to some fellows that he knew, to
whom he thought the lesson should prove useful.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t honestly say that we made much progress at our first
meeting.&nbsp; It was Brown&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; He would begin by telling
us a story about a dog.&nbsp; It was the old, old story of the dog who
had been in the habit of going every morning to a certain baker&rsquo;s
shop with a penny in his mouth, in exchange for which he always received
a penny bun.&nbsp; One day, the baker, thinking he would not know the
difference, tried to palm off upon the poor animal a ha&rsquo;penny
bun, whereupon the dog walked straight outside and fetched in a policeman.&nbsp;
Brown had heard this chestnut for the first time that afternoon, and
was full of it.&nbsp; It is always a mystery to me where Brown has been
for the last hundred years.&nbsp; He stops you in the street with, &ldquo;Oh,
I must tell you!&mdash;such a capital story!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he thereupon
proceeds to relate to you, with much spirit and gusto, one of Noah&rsquo;s
best known jokes, or some story that Romulus must have originally told
to Remus.&nbsp; One of these days somebody will tell him the history
of Adam and Eve, and he will think he has got hold of a new plot, and
will work it up into a novel.</p>
<p>He gives forth these hoary antiquities as personal reminiscences
of his own, or, at furthest, as episodes in the life of his second cousin.&nbsp;
There are certain strange and moving catastrophes that would seem either
to have occurred to, or to have been witnessed by, nearly every one
you meet.&nbsp; I never came across a man yet who had not seen some
other man jerked off the top of an omnibus into a mud-cart.&nbsp; Half
London must, at one time or another, have been jerked off omnibuses
into mud-carts, and have been fished out at the end of a shovel.</p>
<p>Then there is the tale of the lady whose husband is taken suddenly
ill one night at an hotel.&nbsp; She rushes downstairs, and prepares
a stiff mustard plaster to put on him, and runs up with it again.&nbsp;
In her excitement, however, she charges into the wrong room, and, rolling
down the bedclothes, presses it lovingly upon the wrong man.&nbsp; I
have heard that story so often that I am quite nervous about going to
bed in an hotel now.&nbsp; Each man who has told it me has invariably
slept in the room next door to that of the victim, and has been awakened
by the man&rsquo;s yell as the plaster came down upon him.&nbsp; That
is how he (the story-teller) came to know all about it.</p>
<p>Brown wanted us to believe that this prehistoric animal he had been
telling us about had belonged to his brother-in-law, and was hurt when
Jephson murmured, <i>sotto voce</i>, that that made the twenty-eighth
man he had met whose brother-in-law had owned that dog&mdash;to say
nothing of the hundred and seventeen who had owned it themselves.</p>
<p>We tried to get to work afterwards, but Brown had unsettled us for
the evening.&nbsp; It is a wicked thing to start dog stories among a
party of average sinful men.&nbsp; Let one man tell a dog story, and
every other man in the room feels he wants to tell a bigger one.</p>
<p>There is a story going&mdash;I cannot vouch for its truth, it was
told me by a judge&mdash;of a man who lay dying.&nbsp; The pastor of
the parish, a good and pious man, came to sit with him, and, thinking
to cheer him up, told him an anecdote about a dog.&nbsp; When the pastor
had finished, the sick man sat up, and said, &ldquo;I know a better
story than that.&nbsp; I had a dog once, a big, brown, lop-sided&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effort had proved too much for his strength.&nbsp; He fell back
upon the pillows, and the doctor, stepping forward, saw that it was
a question only of minutes.</p>
<p>The good old pastor rose, and took the poor fellow&rsquo;s hand in
his, and pressed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall meet again,&rdquo; he gently
said.</p>
<p>The sick man turned towards him with a consoled and grateful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; he feebly murmured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remind me about that dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he passed peacefully away, with a sweet smile upon his pale
lips.</p>
<p>Brown, who had had his dog story and was satisfied, wanted us to
settle our heroine; but the rest of us did not feel equal to settling
anybody just then.&nbsp; We were thinking of all the true dog stories
we had ever heard, and wondering which was the one least likely to be
generally disbelieved.</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy, in particular, was growing every moment more restless
and moody.&nbsp; Brown concluded a long discourse&mdash;to which nobody
had listened&mdash;by remarking with some pride, &ldquo;What more can
you want?&nbsp; The plot has never been used before, and the characters
are entirely original!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then MacShaughnassy gave way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talking of plots,&rdquo;
he said, hitching his chair a little nearer the table, &ldquo;that puts
me in mind.&nbsp; Did I ever tell you about that dog we had when we
lived in Norwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that one about the bull-dog, is it?&rdquo;
queried Jephson anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a bull-dog,&rdquo; admitted MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever told it you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We knew, by experience, that to argue the matter would only prolong
the torture, so we let him go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many burglaries had lately taken place in our neighbourhood,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;and the pater came to the conclusion that it was time
he laid down a dog.&nbsp; He thought a bull-dog would be the best for
his purpose, and he purchased the most savage and murderous-looking
specimen that he could find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother was alarmed when she saw the dog.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely
you&rsquo;re not going to let that brute loose about the house!&rsquo;
she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll kill somebody.&nbsp; I can see
it in his face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want him to kill somebody,&rsquo; replied my father;
&lsquo;I want him to kill burglars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk like that, Thomas,&rsquo;
answered the mater; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not like you.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
a right to protect our property, but we&rsquo;ve no right to take a
fellow human creature&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Our fellow human creatures will be all right&mdash;so
long as they don&rsquo;t come into our kitchen when they&rsquo;ve no
business there,&rsquo; retorted my father, somewhat testily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
going to fix up this dog in the scullery, and if a burglar comes fooling
around&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s <i>his</i> affair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old folks quarrelled on and off for about a month over
this dog.&nbsp; The dad thought the mater absurdly sentimental, and
the mater thought the dad unnecessarily vindictive.&nbsp; Meanwhile
the dog grew more ferocious-looking every day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night my mother woke my father up with: &lsquo;Thomas,
there&rsquo;s a burglar downstairs, I&rsquo;m positive.&nbsp; I distinctly
heard the kitchen door open.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, well, the dog&rsquo;s got him by now, then,&rsquo;
murmured my father, who had heard nothing, and was sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thomas,&rsquo; replied my mother severely, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to lie here while a fellow-creature is being murdered by a
savage beast.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t go down and save that man&rsquo;s
life, I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, bother,&rsquo; said my father, preparing to get
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re always fancying you hear noises.&nbsp;
I believe that&rsquo;s all you women come to bed for&mdash;to sit up
and listen for burglars.&rsquo;&nbsp; Just to satisfy her, however,
he pulled on his trousers and socks, and went down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sure enough, my mother was right, this time.&nbsp; There
<i>was</i> a burglar in the house.&nbsp; The pantry window stood open,
and a light was shining in the kitchen.&nbsp; My father crept softly
forward, and peeped through the partly open door.&nbsp; There sat the
burglar, eating cold beef and pickles, and there, beside him, on the
floor, gazing up into his face with a blood-curdling smile of affection,
sat that idiot of a dog, wagging his tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was so taken aback that he forgot to keep silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;,&rsquo; and he used a word that
I should not care to repeat to you fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burglar, hearing him, made a dash, and got clear off by
the window; and the dog seemed vexed with my father for having driven
him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning we took the dog back to the trainer from whom
we had bought it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think I wanted this dog for?&rsquo; asked
my father, trying to speak calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the trainer, &lsquo;you said you
wanted a good house dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; answered the dad.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t ask for a burglar&rsquo;s companion, did I?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
say I wanted a dog who&rsquo;d chum on with a burglar the first time
he ever came to the house, and sit with him while he had supper, in
case he might feel lonesome, did I?&rsquo;&nbsp; And my father recounted
the incidents of the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man agreed that there was cause for complaint.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what it is, sir,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was my boy
Jim as trained this &rsquo;ere dawg, and I guess the young beggar&rsquo;s
taught &rsquo;im more about tackling rats than burglars.&nbsp; You leave
&rsquo;im with me for a week, sir; I&rsquo;ll put that all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did so, and at the end of the time the trainer brought
him back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find &rsquo;im game enough now, sir,&rsquo;
said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t what I call an intellectual
dawg, but I think I&rsquo;ve knocked the right idea into &rsquo;im.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father thought he&rsquo;d like to test the matter, so we
hired a man for a shilling to break in through the kitchen window while
the trainer held the dog by a chain.&nbsp; The dog remained perfectly
quiet until the man was fairly inside.&nbsp; Then he made one savage
spring at him, and if the chain had not been stout the fellow would
have earned his shilling dearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dad was satisfied now that he could go to bed in peace;
and the mater&rsquo;s alarm for the safety of the local burglars was
proportionately increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Months passed uneventfully by, and then another burglar sampled
our house.&nbsp; This time there could be no doubt that the dog was
doing something for his living.&nbsp; The din in the basement was terrific.&nbsp;
The house shook with the concussion of falling bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father snatched up his revolver and rushed downstairs,
and I followed him.&nbsp; The kitchen was in confusion.&nbsp; Tables
and chairs were overturned, and on the floor lay a man gurgling for
help.&nbsp; The dog was standing over him, choking him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pater held his revolver to the man&rsquo;s ear, while
I, by superhuman effort, dragged our preserver away, and chained him
up to the sink, after which I lit the gas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we perceived that the gentleman on the floor was a police
constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; exclaimed my father, dropping
the revolver, &lsquo;however did you come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow did <i>I</i> come &rsquo;ere?&rsquo; retorted
the man, sitting up and speaking in a tone of bitter, but not unnatural,
indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, in the course of my dooty, that&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ow <i>I</i> come &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; I see a burglar getting in
through the window, so I just follows and slips in after &rsquo;im.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you catch him?&rsquo; asked my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did I catch &rsquo;im!&rsquo; almost shrieked the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow could I catch &rsquo;im with that blasted dog of yours
&rsquo;olding me down by the throat, while &rsquo;e lights &rsquo;is
pipe and walks out by the back door?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog was for sale the next day.&nbsp; The mater, who had
grown to like him, because he let the baby pull his tail, wanted us
to keep him.&nbsp; The mistake, she said, was not the animal&rsquo;s
fault.&nbsp; Two men broke into the house almost at the same time.&nbsp;
The dog could not go for both of them.&nbsp; He did his best, and went
for one.&nbsp; That his selection should have fallen upon the policeman
instead of upon the burglar was unfortunate.&nbsp; But still it was
a thing that might have happened to any dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, however, had become prejudiced against the poor
creature, and that same week he inserted an advertisement in <i>The
Field</i>, in which the animal was recommended as an investment likely
to prove useful to any enterprising member of the criminal classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy having had his innings, Jephson took a turn, and told
us a pathetic story about an unfortunate mongrel that was run over in
the Strand one day and its leg broken.&nbsp; A medical student, who
was passing at the time, picked it up and carried it to the Charing
Cross Hospital, where its leg was set, and where it was kept and tended
until it was quite itself again, when it was sent home.</p>
<p>The poor thing had quite understood what was being done for it, and
had been the most grateful patient they had ever had in the hospital.&nbsp;
The whole staff were quite sorry when it left.</p>
<p>One morning, a week or two later, the house-surgeon, looking out
of the window, saw the dog coming down the street.&nbsp; When it came
near he noticed that it had a penny in its mouth.&nbsp; A cat&rsquo;s-meat
barrow was standing by the kerb, and for a moment, as he passed it,
the dog hesitated.</p>
<p>But his nobler nature asserted itself, and, walking straight up to
the hospital railings, and raising himself upon his hind legs, he dropped
his penny into the contribution box.</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy was much affected by this story.&nbsp; He said it
showed such a beautiful trait in the dog&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; The
animal was a poor outcast, vagrant thing, that had perhaps never possessed
a penny before in all its life, and might never have another.&nbsp;
He said that dog&rsquo;s penny seemed to him to be a greater gift than
the biggest cheque that the wealthiest patron ever signed.</p>
<p>The other three were very eager now to get to work on the novel,
but I did not quite see the fairness of this.&nbsp; I had one or two
dog stories of my own.</p>
<p>I knew a black-and-tan terrier years ago.&nbsp; He lodged in the
same house with me.&nbsp; He did not belong to any one.&nbsp; He had
discharged his owner (if, indeed, he had ever permitted himself to possess
one, which is doubtful, having regard to his aggressively independent
character), and was now running himself entirely on his own account.&nbsp;
He appropriated the front hall for his sleeping-apartment, and took
his meals with the other lodgers&mdash;whenever they happened to be
having meals.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock he would take an early morning snack with young
Hollis, an engineer&rsquo;s pupil, who had to get up at half-past four
and make his own coffee, so as to be down at the works by six.&nbsp;
At eight-thirty he would breakfast in a more sensible fashion with Mr.
Blair, on the first floor, and on occasions would join Jack Gadbut,
who was a late riser, in a devilled kidney at eleven.</p>
<p>From then till about five, when I generally had a cup of tea and
a chop, he regularly disappeared.&nbsp; Where he went and what he did
between those hours nobody ever knew.&nbsp; Gadbut swore that twice
he had met him coming out of a stockbroker&rsquo;s office in Threadneedle
Street, and, improbable though the statement at first appeared, some
colour of credibility began to attach to it when we reflected upon the
dog&rsquo;s inordinate passion for acquiring and hoarding coppers.</p>
<p>This craving of his for wealth was really quite remarkable.&nbsp;
He was an elderly dog, with a great sense of his own dignity; yet, on
the promise of a penny, I have seen him run round after his own tail
until he didn&rsquo;t know one end of himself from the other.</p>
<p>He used to teach himself tricks, and go from room to room in the
evening, performing them, and when he had completed his programme he
would sit up and beg.&nbsp; All the fellows used to humour him.&nbsp;
He must have made pounds in the course of the year.</p>
<p>Once, just outside our door, I saw him standing in a crowd, watching
a performing poodle attached to a hurdy-gurdy.&nbsp; The poodle stood
on his head, and then, with his hind legs in the air, walked round on
his front paws.&nbsp; The people laughed very much, and, when afterwards
he came amongst them with his wooden saucer in his mouth, they gave
freely.</p>
<p>Our dog came in and immediately commenced to study.&nbsp; In three
days <i>he</i> could stand on his head and walk round on his front legs,
and the first evening he did so he made sixpence.&nbsp; It must have
been terribly hard work for him at his age, and subject to rheumatism
as he was; but he would do anything for money.&nbsp; I believe he would
have sold himself to the devil for eightpence down.</p>
<p>He knew the value of money.&nbsp; If you held out to him a penny
in one hand and a threepenny-bit in the other, he would snatch at the
threepence, and then break his heart because he could not get the penny
in as well.&nbsp; You might safely have left him in the room with a
leg of mutton, but it would not have been wise to leave your purse about.</p>
<p>Now and then he spent a little, but not often.&nbsp; He was desperately
fond of sponge-cakes, and occasionally, when he had had a good week,
he would indulge himself to the extent of one or two.&nbsp; But he hated
paying for them, and always made a frantic and frequently successful
effort to get off with the cake and the penny also.&nbsp; His plan of
operations was simple.&nbsp; He would walk into the shop with his penny
in his mouth, well displayed, and a sweet and lamblike expression in
his eyes.&nbsp; Taking his stand as near to the cakes as he could get,
and fixing his eyes affectionately upon them, he would begin to whine,
and the shopkeeper, thinking he was dealing with an honest dog, would
throw him one.</p>
<p>To get the cake he was obliged, of course, to drop the penny, and
then began a struggle between him and the shopkeeper for the possession
of the coin.&nbsp; The man would try to pick it up.&nbsp; The dog would
put his foot upon it, and growl savagely.&nbsp; If he could finish the
cake before the contest was over, he would snap up the penny and bolt.&nbsp;
I have known him to come home gorged with sponge-cakes, the original
penny still in his mouth.</p>
<p>So notorious throughout the neighbourhood did this dishonest practice
of his become, that, after a time, the majority of the local tradespeople
refused to serve him at all.&nbsp; Only the exceptionally quick and
able-bodied would attempt to do business with him.</p>
<p>Then he took his custom further afield, into districts where his
reputation had not yet penetrated.&nbsp; And he would pick out shops
kept by nervous females or rheumatic old men.</p>
<p>They say that the love of money is the root of all evil.&nbsp; It
seemed to have robbed him of every shred of principle.</p>
<p>It robbed him of his life in the end, and that came about in this
way.&nbsp; He had been performing one evening in Gadbut&rsquo;s room,
where a few of us were sitting smoking and talking; and young Hollis,
being in a generous mood, had thrown him, as he thought, a sixpence.&nbsp;
The dog grabbed it, and retired under the sofa.&nbsp; This was an odd
thing for him to do, and we commented upon it.&nbsp; Suddenly a thought
occurred to Hollis, and he took out his money and began counting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given that
little beast half-a-sovereign&mdash;here, Tiny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tiny only backed further underneath the sofa, and no mere verbal
invitation would induce him to stir.&nbsp; So we adopted a more pressing
plan, and coaxed him out by the scruff of his neck.</p>
<p>He came, an inch at a time, growling viciously, and holding Hollis&rsquo;s
half-sovereign tight between his teeth.&nbsp; We tried sweet reasonableness
at first.&nbsp; We offered him a sixpence in exchange; he looked insulted,
and evidently considered the proposal as tantamount to our calling him
a fool.&nbsp; We made it a shilling, then half-a-crown&mdash;he seemed
only bored by our persistence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever see this half-sovereign
again, Hollis,&rdquo; said Gadbut, laughing.&nbsp; We all, with the
exception of young Hollis, thought the affair a very good joke.&nbsp;
He, on the contrary, seemed annoyed, and, taking the dog from Gadbut,
made an attempt to pull the coin out of its mouth.</p>
<p>Tiny, true to his life-long principle of never parting if he could
possibly help it, held on like grim death, until, feeling that his little
earnings were slowly but surely going from him, he made one final desperate
snatch, and swallowed the money.&nbsp; It stuck in his throat, and he
began to choke.</p>
<p>Then we became seriously alarmed for the dog.&nbsp; He was an amusing
chap, and we did not want any accident to happen to him.&nbsp; Hollis
rushed into his room and procured a long pair of pincers, and the rest
of us held the little miser while Hollis tried to relieve him of the
cause of his suffering.</p>
<p>But poor Tiny did not understand our intentions.&nbsp; He still thought
we were seeking to rob him of his night&rsquo;s takings, and resisted
vehemently.&nbsp; His struggles fixed the coin firmer, and, in spite
of our efforts, he died&mdash;one more victim, among many, to the fierce
fever for gold.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>I dreamt a very curious dream about riches once, that made a great
impression upon me.&nbsp; I thought that I and a friend&mdash;a very
dear friend&mdash;were living together in a strange old house.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think anybody else dwelt in the house but just we two.&nbsp;
One day, wandering about this strange old rambling place, I discovered
the hidden door of a secret room, and in this room were many iron-bound
chests, and when I raised the heavy lids I saw that each chest was full
of gold.</p>
<p>And, when I saw this, I stole out softly and closed the hidden door,
and drew the worn tapestries in front of it again, and crept back along
the dim corridor, looking behind me, fearfully.</p>
<p>And the friend that I had loved came towards me, and we walked together
with our hands clasped.&nbsp; But I hated him.</p>
<p>And all day long I kept beside him, or followed him unseen, lest
by chance he should learn the secret of that hidden door; and at night
I lay awake watching him.</p>
<p>But one night I sleep, and, when I open my eyes, he is no longer
near me.&nbsp; I run swiftly up the narrow stairs and along the silent
corridor.&nbsp; The tapestry is drawn aside, and the hidden door stands
open, and in the room beyond the friend that I loved is kneeling before
an open chest, and the glint of the gold is in my eyes.</p>
<p>His back is towards me, and I crawl forward inch by inch.&nbsp; I
have a knife in my hand, with a strong, curved blade; and when I am
near enough I kill him as he kneels there.</p>
<p>His body falls against the door, and it shuts to with a clang, and
I try to open it, and cannot.&nbsp; I beat my hands against its iron
nails, and scream, and the dead man grins at me.&nbsp; The light streams
in through the chink beneath the massive door, and fades, and comes
again, and fades again, and I gnaw at the oaken lids of the iron-bound
chests, for the madness of hunger is climbing into my brain.</p>
<p>Then I awake, and find that I really am hungry, and remember that
in consequence of a headache I did not eat any dinner.&nbsp; So I slip
on a few clothes, and go down to the kitchen on a foraging expedition.</p>
<p>It is said that dreams are momentary conglomerations of thought,
centring round the incident that awakens us, and, as with most scientific
facts, this is occasionally true.&nbsp; There is one dream that, with
slight variations, is continually recurring to me.&nbsp; Over and over
again I dream that I am suddenly called upon to act an important part
in some piece at the Lyceum.&nbsp; That poor Mr. Irving should invariably
be the victim seems unfair, but really it is entirely his own fault.&nbsp;
It is he who persuades and urges me.&nbsp; I myself would much prefer
to remain quietly in bed, and I tell him so.&nbsp; But he insists on
my getting up at once and coming down to the theatre.&nbsp; I explain
to him that I can&rsquo;t act a bit.&nbsp; He seems to consider this
unimportant, and says, &ldquo;Oh, that will be all right.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We argue for a while, but he makes the matter quite a personal one,
and to oblige him and get him out of the bedroom I consent, though much
against my own judgment.&nbsp; I generally dress the character in my
nightshirt, though on one occasion, for Banquo, I wore pyjamas, and
I never remember a single word of what I ought to say.&nbsp; How I get
through I do not know.&nbsp; Irving comes up afterwards and congratulates
me, but whether upon the brilliancy of my performance, or upon my luck
in getting off the stage before a brickbat is thrown at me, I cannot
say.</p>
<p>Whenever I dream this incident I invariably wake up to find that
the bedclothes are on the floor, and that I am shivering with cold;
and it is this shivering, I suppose, that causes me to dream I am wandering
about the Lyceum stage in nothing but my nightshirt.&nbsp; But still
I do not understand why it should always be the Lyceum.</p>
<p>Another dream which I fancy I have dreamt more than once&mdash;or,
if not, I have dreamt that I dreamt it before, a thing one sometimes
does&mdash;is one in which I am walking down a very wide and very long
road in the East End of London.&nbsp; It is a curious road to find there.&nbsp;
Omnibuses and trams pass up and down, and it is crowded with stalls
and barrows, beside which men in greasy caps stand shouting; yet on
each side it is bordered by a strip of tropical forest.&nbsp; The road,
in fact, combines the advantages of Kew and Whitechapel.</p>
<p>Some one is with me, but I cannot see him, and we walk through the
forest, pushing our way among the tangled vines that cling about our
feet, and every now and then, between the giant tree-trunks, we catch
glimpses of the noisy street.</p>
<p>At the end of this road there is a narrow turning, and when I come
to it I am afraid, though I do not know why I am afraid.&nbsp; It leads
to a house that I once lived in when a child, and now there is some
one waiting there who has something to tell me.</p>
<p>I turn to run away.&nbsp; A Blackwall &rsquo;bus is passing, and
I try to overtake it.&nbsp; But the horses turn into skeletons and gallop
away from me, and my feet are like lead, and the thing that is with
me, and that I cannot see, seizes me by the arm and drags me back.</p>
<p>It forces me along, and into the house, and the door slams to behind
us, and the sound echoes through the lifeless rooms.&nbsp; I recognise
the rooms; I laughed and cried in them long ago.&nbsp; Nothing is changed.&nbsp;
The chairs stand in their places, empty.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s knitting
lies upon the hearthrug, where the kitten, I remember, dragged it, somewhere
back in the sixties.</p>
<p>I go up into my own little attic.&nbsp; My cot stands in the corner,
and my bricks lie tumbled out upon the floor (I was always an untidy
child).&nbsp; An old man enters&mdash;an old, bent, withered man&mdash;holding
a lamp above his head, and I look at his face, and it is my own face.&nbsp;
And another enters, and he also is myself.&nbsp; Then more and more,
till the room is thronged with faces, and the stair-way beyond, and
all the silent house.&nbsp; Some of the faces are old and others young,
and some are fair and smile at me, and many are foul and leer at me.&nbsp;
And every face is my own face, but no two of them are alike.</p>
<p>I do not know why the sight of myself should alarm me so, but I rush
from the house in terror, and the faces follow me; and I run faster
and faster, but I know that I shall never leave them behind me.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>As a rule one is the hero of one&rsquo;s own dreams, but at times
I have dreamt a dream entirely in the third person&mdash;a dream with
the incidents of which I have had no connection whatever, except as
an unseen and impotent spectator.&nbsp; One of these I have often thought
about since, wondering if it could not be worked up into a story.&nbsp;
But, perhaps, it would be too painful a theme.</p>
<p>I dreamt I saw a woman&rsquo;s face among a throng.&nbsp; It is an
evil face, but there is a strange beauty in it.&nbsp; The flickering
gleams thrown by street lamps flash down upon it, showing the wonder
of its evil fairness.&nbsp; Then the lights go out.</p>
<p>I see it next in a place that is very far away, and it is even more
beautiful than before, for the evil has gone out of it.&nbsp; Another
face is looking down into it, a bright, pure face.&nbsp; The faces meet
and kiss, and, as his lips touch hers, the blood mounts to her cheeks
and brow.&nbsp; I see the two faces again.&nbsp; But I cannot tell where
they are or how long a time has passed.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s face has
grown a little older, but it is still young and fair, and when the woman&rsquo;s
eyes rest upon it there comes a glory into her face so that it is like
the face of an angel.&nbsp; But at times the woman is alone, and then
I see the old evil look struggling back.</p>
<p>Then I see clearer.&nbsp; I see the room in which they live.&nbsp;
It is very poor.&nbsp; An old-fashioned piano stands in one corner,
and beside it is a table on which lie scattered a tumbled mass of papers
round an ink-stand.&nbsp; An empty chair waits before the table.&nbsp;
The woman sits by the open window.</p>
<p>From far below there rises the sound of a great city.&nbsp; Its lights
throw up faint beams into the dark room.&nbsp; The smell of its streets
is in the woman&rsquo;s nostrils.</p>
<p>Every now and again she looks towards the door and listens: then
turns to the open window.&nbsp; And I notice that each time she looks
towards the door the evil in her face shrinks back; but each time she
turns to the window it grows more fierce and sullen.</p>
<p>Suddenly she starts up, and there is a terror in her eyes that frightens
me as I dream, and I see great beads of sweat upon her brow.&nbsp; Then,
very slowly, her face changes, and I see again the evil creature of
the night.&nbsp; She wraps around her an old cloak, and creeps out.&nbsp;
I hear her footsteps going down the stairs.&nbsp; They grow fainter
and fainter.&nbsp; I hear a door open.&nbsp; The roar of the streets
rushes up into the house, and the woman&rsquo;s footsteps are swallowed
up.</p>
<p>Time drifts onward through my dream.&nbsp; Scenes change, take shape,
and fade; but all is vague and undefined, until, out of the dimness,
there fashions itself a long, deserted street.&nbsp; The lights make
glistening circles on the wet pavement.&nbsp; A figure, dressed in gaudy
rags, slinks by, keeping close against the wall.&nbsp; Its back is towards
me, and I do not see its face.&nbsp; Another figure glides from out
the shadows.&nbsp; I look upon its face, and I see it is the face that
the woman&rsquo;s eyes gazed up into and worshipped long ago, when my
dream was just begun.&nbsp; But the fairness and the purity are gone
from it, and it is old and evil, as the woman&rsquo;s when I looked
upon her last.&nbsp; The figure in the gaudy rags moves slowly on.&nbsp;
The second figure follows it, and overtakes it.&nbsp; The two pause,
and speak to one another as they draw near.&nbsp; The street is very
dark where they have met, and the figure in the gaudy rags keeps its
face still turned aside.&nbsp; They walk together in silence, till they
come to where a flaring gas-lamp hangs before a tavern; and there the
woman turns, and I see that it is the woman of my dream.&nbsp; And she
and the man look into each other&rsquo;s eyes once more.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In another dream that I remember, an angel (or a devil, I am not
quite sure which) has come to a man and told him that so long as he
loves no living human thing&mdash;so long as he never suffers himself
to feel one touch of tenderness towards wife or child, towards kith
or kin, towards stranger or towards friend, so long will he succeed
and prosper in his dealings&mdash;so long will all this world&rsquo;s
affairs go well with him; and he will grow each day richer and greater
and more powerful.&nbsp; But if ever he let one kindly thought for living
thing come into his heart, in that moment all his plans and schemes
will topple down about his ears; and from that hour his name will be
despised by men, and then forgotten.</p>
<p>And the man treasures up these words, for he is an ambitious man,
and wealth and fame and power are the sweetest things in all the world
to him.&nbsp; A woman loves him and dies, thirsting for a loving look
from him; children&rsquo;s footsteps creep into his life and steal away
again, old faces fade and new ones come and go.</p>
<p>But never a kindly touch of his hand rests on any living thing; never
a kindly word comes from his lips; never a kindly thought springs from
his heart.&nbsp; And in all his doings fortune favours him.</p>
<p>The years pass by, and at last there is left to him only one thing
that he need fear&mdash;a child&rsquo;s small, wistful face.&nbsp; The
child loves him, as the woman, long ago, had loved him, and her eyes
follow him with a hungry, beseeching look.&nbsp; But he sets his teeth,
and turns away from her.</p>
<p>The little face grows thin, and one day they come to him where he
sits before the keyboard of his many enterprises, and tell him she is
dying.&nbsp; He comes and stands beside the bed, and the child&rsquo;s
eyes open and turn towards him; and, as he draws nearer, her little
arms stretch out towards him, pleading dumbly.&nbsp; But the man&rsquo;s
face never changes, and the little arms fall feebly back upon the tumbled
coverlet, and the wistful eyes grow still, and a woman steps softly
forward, and draws the lids down over them; then the man goes back to
his plans and schemes.</p>
<p>But in the night, when the great house is silent, he steals up to
the room where the child still lies, and pushes back the white, uneven
sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;dead,&rdquo; he mutters.&nbsp; Then he takes the
tiny corpse up in his arms, and holds it tight against his breast, and
kisses the cold lips, and the cold cheeks, and the little, cold, stiff
hands.</p>
<p>And at that point my story becomes impossible, for I dream that the
dead child lies always beneath the sheet in that quiet room, and that
the little face never changes, nor the limbs decay.</p>
<p>I puzzle about this for an instant, but soon forget to wonder; for
when the Dream Fairy tells us tales we are only as little children,
sitting round with open eyes, believing all, though marvelling that
such things should be.</p>
<p>Each night, when all else in the house sleeps, the door of that room
opens noiselessly, and the man enters and closes it behind him.&nbsp;
Each night he draws away the white sheet, and takes the small dead body
in his arms; and through the dark hours he paces softly to and fro,
holding it close against his breast, kissing it and crooning to it,
like a mother to her sleeping baby.</p>
<p>When the first ray of dawn peeps into the room, he lays the dead
child back again, and smooths the sheet above her, and steals away.</p>
<p>And he succeeds and prospers in all things, and each day he grows
richer and greater and more powerful.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>We had much trouble with our heroine.&nbsp; Brown wanted her ugly.&nbsp;
Brown&rsquo;s chief ambition in life is to be original, and his method
of obtaining the original is to take the unoriginal and turn it upside
down.</p>
<p>If Brown were given a little planet of his own to do as he liked
with, he would call day, night, and summer, winter.&nbsp; He would make
all his men and women walk on their heads and shake hands with their
feet, his trees would grow with their roots in the air, and the old
cock would lay all the eggs while the hens sat on the fence and crowed.&nbsp;
Then he would step back and say, &ldquo;See what an original world I
have created, entirely my own idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many other people besides Brown whose notion of originality
would seem to be precisely similar.</p>
<p>I know a little girl, the descendant of a long line of politicians.&nbsp;
The hereditary instinct is so strongly developed in her that she is
almost incapable of thinking for herself.&nbsp; Instead, she copies
in everything her elder sister, who takes more after the mother.&nbsp;
If her sister has two helpings of rice pudding for supper, then she
has two helpings of rice pudding.&nbsp; If her sister isn&rsquo;t hungry
and doesn&rsquo;t want any supper at all, then she goes to bed without
any supper.</p>
<p>This lack of character in the child troubles her mother, who is not
an admirer of the political virtues, and one evening, taking the little
one on her lap, she talked seriously to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do try to think for yourself,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
always do just what Jessie does, that&rsquo;s silly.&nbsp; Have an idea
of your own now and then.&nbsp; Be a little original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child promised she&rsquo;d try, and went to bed thoughtful.</p>
<p>Next morning, for breakfast, a dish of kippers and a dish of kidneys
were placed on the table, side by side.&nbsp; Now the child loved kippers
with an affection that amounted almost to passion, while she loathed
kidneys worse than powders.&nbsp; It was the one subject on which she
did know her own mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kidney or a kipper for you, Jessie?&rdquo; asked the mother,
addressing the elder child first.</p>
<p>Jessie hesitated for a moment, while her sister sat regarding her
in an agony of suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kipper, please, ma,&rdquo; Jessie answered at last, and the
younger child turned her head away to hide the tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a kipper, of course, Trixy?&rdquo; said
the mother, who had noticed nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, ma,&rdquo; said the small heroine, stifling
a sob, and speaking in a dry, tremulous voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
a kidney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you couldn&rsquo;t bear kidneys,&rdquo; exclaimed
her mother, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma, I don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re so fond of kippers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why on earth don&rsquo;t you have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos Jessie&rsquo;s going to have one, and you told
me to be original,&rdquo; and here the poor mite, reflecting upon the
price her originality was going to cost her, burst into tears.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The other three of us refused to sacrifice ourselves upon the altar
of Brown&rsquo;s originality.&nbsp; We decided to be content with the
customary beautiful girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good or bad?&rdquo; queried Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; responded MacShaughnassy emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
do you say, Jephson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Jephson, taking the pipe from between
his lips, and speaking in that soothingly melancholy tone of voice that
he never varies, whether telling a joke about a wedding or an anecdote
relating to a funeral, &ldquo;not altogether bad.&nbsp; Bad, with good
instincts, the good instincts well under control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why it is,&rdquo; murmured MacShaughnassy reflectively,
&ldquo;that bad people are so much more interesting than good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the reason is very difficult to find,&rdquo;
answered Jephson.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more uncertainty about
them.&nbsp; They keep you more on the alert.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like the
difference between riding a well-broken, steady-going hack and a lively
young colt with ideas of his own.&nbsp; The one is comfortable to travel
on, but the other provides you with more exercise.&nbsp; If you start
off with a thoroughly good woman for your heroine you give your story
away in the first chapter.&nbsp; Everybody knows precisely how she will
behave under every conceivable combination of circumstances in which
you can place her.&nbsp; On every occasion she will do the same thing&mdash;that
is the right thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a bad heroine, on the other hand, you can never be quite
sure what is going to happen.&nbsp; Out of the fifty or so courses open
to her, she may take the right one, or she may take one of the forty-nine
wrong ones, and you watch her with curiosity to see which it will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely there are plenty of good heroines who are interesting,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At intervals&mdash;when they do something wrong,&rdquo; answered
Jephson.&nbsp; &ldquo;A consistently irreproachable heroine is as irritating
as Socrates must have been to Xantippe, or as the model boy at school
is to all the other lads.&nbsp; Take the stock heroine of the eighteenth-century
romance.&nbsp; She never met her lover except for the purpose of telling
him that she could not be his, and she generally wept steadily throughout
the interview.&nbsp; She never forgot to turn pale at the sight of blood,
nor to faint in his arms at the most inconvenient moment possible.&nbsp;
She was determined never to marry without her father&rsquo;s consent,
and was equally resolved never to marry anybody but the one particular
person she was convinced he would never agree to her marrying.&nbsp;
She was an excellent young woman, and nearly as uninteresting as a celebrity
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you&rsquo;re not talking about good women now,&rdquo;
I observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about some silly person&rsquo;s
idea of a good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite admit it,&rdquo; replied Jephson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor,
indeed, am I prepared to say what is a good woman.&nbsp; I consider
the subject too deep and too complicated for any mere human being to
give judgment upon.&nbsp; But I <i>am</i> talking of the women who conformed
to the popular idea of maidenly goodness in the age when these books
were written.&nbsp; You must remember goodness is not a known quantity.&nbsp;
It varies with every age and every locality, and it is, generally speaking,
your &lsquo;silly persons&rsquo; who are responsible for its varying
standards.&nbsp; In Japan, a &lsquo;good&rsquo; girl would be a girl
who would sell her honour in order to afford little luxuries to her
aged parents.&nbsp; In certain hospitable islands of the torrid zone
the &lsquo;good&rsquo; wife goes to lengths that we should deem altogether
unnecessary in making her husband&rsquo;s guest feel himself at home.&nbsp;
In ancient Hebraic days, Jael was accounted a good woman for murdering
a sleeping man, and Sarai stood in no danger of losing the respect of
her little world when she led Hagar unto Abraham.&nbsp; In eighteenth-century
England, supernatural stupidity and dulness of a degree that must have
been difficult to attain, were held to be feminine virtues&mdash;indeed,
they are so still&mdash;and authors, who are always among the most servile
followers of public opinion, fashioned their puppets accordingly.&nbsp;
Nowadays &lsquo;slumming&rsquo; is the most applauded virtue, and so
all our best heroines go slumming, and are &lsquo;good to the poor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How useful &lsquo;the poor&rsquo; are,&rdquo; remarked MacShaughnassy,
somewhat abruptly, placing his feet on the mantelpiece, and tilting
his chair back till it stood at an angle that caused us to rivet our
attention upon it with hopeful interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think we scribbling fellows ever fully grasp how much we owe to &lsquo;the
poor.&rsquo;&nbsp; Where would our angelic heroines and our noble-hearted
heroes be if it were not for &lsquo;the poor&rsquo;?&nbsp; We want to
show that the dear girl is as good as she is beautiful.&nbsp; What do
we do?&nbsp; We put a basket full of chickens and bottles of wine on
her arm, a fetching little sun-bonnet on her head, and send her round
among the poor.&nbsp; How do we prove that our apparent scamp of a hero
is really a noble young man at heart?&nbsp; Why, by explaining that
he is good to the poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are as useful in real life as they are in Bookland.&nbsp;
What is it consoles the tradesman when the actor, earning eighty pounds
a week, cannot pay his debts?&nbsp; Why, reading in the theatrical newspapers
gushing accounts of the dear fellow&rsquo;s invariable generosity to
the poor.&nbsp; What is it stills the small but irritating voice of
conscience when we have successfully accomplished some extra big feat
of swindling?&nbsp; Why, the noble resolve to give ten per cent of the
net profits to the poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does a man do when he finds himself growing old, and
feels that it is time for him to think seriously about securing his
position in the next world?&nbsp; Why, he becomes suddenly good to the
poor.&nbsp; If the poor were not there for him to be good to, what could
he do?&nbsp; He would be unable to reform at all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
great comfort to think that the poor will always be with us.&nbsp; They
are the ladder by which we climb into heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments, while MacShaughnassy puffed
away vigorously, and almost savagely, at his pipe, and then Brown said:
&ldquo;I can tell you rather a quaint incident, bearing very aptly on
the subject.&nbsp; A cousin of mine was a land-agent in a small country
town, and among the houses on his list was a fine old mansion that had
remained vacant for many years.&nbsp; He had despaired of ever selling
it, when one day an elderly lady, very richly dressed, drove up to the
office and made inquiries about it.&nbsp; She said she had come across
it accidentally while travelling through that part of the country the
previous autumn, and had been much struck by its beauty and picturesqueness.&nbsp;
She added she was looking out for some quiet spot where she could settle
down and peacefully pass the remainder of her days, and thought this
place might possibly prove to be the very thing for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin, delighted with the chance of a purchaser, at once
drove her across to the estate, which was about eight miles distant
from the town, and they went over it together.&nbsp; My cousin waxed
eloquent upon the subject of its advantages.&nbsp; He dwelt upon its
quiet and seclusion, its proximity&mdash;but not too close proximity&mdash;to
the church, its convenient distance from the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything pointed to a satisfactory conclusion of the business.&nbsp;
The lady was charmed with the situation and the surroundings, and delighted
with the house and grounds.&nbsp; She considered the price moderate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now, Mr. Brown,&rsquo; said she, as they stood
by the lodge gate, &lsquo;tell me, what class of poor have you got round
about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor?&rsquo; answered my cousin; &lsquo;there are no
poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No poor!&rsquo; exclaimed the lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
poor people in the village, or anywhere near?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t find a poor person within five miles
of the estate,&rsquo; he replied proudly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see, my dear
madam, this is a thinly populated and exceedingly prosperous county:
this particular district especially so.&nbsp; There is not a family
in it that is not, comparatively speaking, well-to-do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rsquo; said the lady,
in a tone of disappointment.&nbsp; &lsquo;The place would have suited
me so admirably but for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But surely, madam,&rsquo; cried my cousin, to whom
a demand for poor persons was an entirely new idea, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
mean to say that you <i>want</i> poor people!&nbsp; Why, we&rsquo;ve
always considered it one of the chief attractions of the property&mdash;nothing
to shock the eye or wound the susceptibilities of the most tender-hearted
occupant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Mr. Brown,&rsquo; replied the lady, &lsquo;I
will be perfectly frank with you.&nbsp; I am becoming an old woman,
and my past life has not, perhaps, been altogether too well spent.&nbsp;
It is my desire to atone for the&mdash;er&mdash;follies of my youth
by an old age of well-doing, and to that end it is essential that I
should be surrounded by a certain number of deserving poor.&nbsp; I
had hoped to find in this charming neighbourhood of yours the customary
proportion of poverty and misery, in which case I should have taken
the house without hesitation.&nbsp; As it is, I must seek elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin was perplexed, and sad.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are plenty
of poor people in the town,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;many of them most
interesting cases, and you could have the entire care of them all.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;d be no opposition whatever, I&rsquo;m positive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; replied the lady, &lsquo;but I really
couldn&rsquo;t go as far as the town.&nbsp; They must be within easy
driving distance or they are no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin cudgelled his brains again.&nbsp; He did not intend
to let a purchaser slip through his fingers if he could help it.&nbsp;
At last a bright thought flashed into his mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what we could do,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
a piece of waste land the other end of the village that we&rsquo;ve
never been able to do much with, in consequence of its being so swampy.&nbsp;
If you liked, we could run you up a dozen cottages on that, cheap&mdash;it
would be all the better their being a bit ramshackle and unhealthy&mdash;and
get some poor people for you, and put into them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady reflected upon the idea, and it struck her as a good
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; continued my cousin, pushing his advantage,
&lsquo;by adopting this method you would be able to select your own
poor.&nbsp; We would get you some nice, clean, grateful poor, and make
the thing pleasant for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ended in the lady&rsquo;s accepting my cousin&rsquo;s offer,
and giving him a list of the poor people she would like to have.&nbsp;
She selected one bedridden old woman (Church of England preferred);
one paralytic old man; one blind girl who would want to be read aloud
to; one poor atheist, willing to be converted; two cripples; one drunken
father who would consent to be talked to seriously; one disagreeable
old fellow, needing much patience; two large families, and four ordinary
assorted couples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin experienced some difficulty in securing the drunken
father.&nbsp; Most of the drunken fathers he interviewed upon the subject
had a rooted objection to being talked to at all.&nbsp; After a long
search, however, he discovered a mild little man, who, upon the lady&rsquo;s
requirements and charitable intentions being explained to him, undertook
to qualify himself for the vacancy by getting intoxicated at least once
a week.&nbsp; He said he could not promise more than once a week at
first, he unfortunately possessing a strong natural distaste for all
alcoholic liquors, which it would be necessary for him to overcome.&nbsp;
As he got more used to them, he would do better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the disagreeable old man, my cousin also had trouble.&nbsp;
It was hard to hit the right degree of disagreeableness.&nbsp; Some
of them were so very unpleasant.&nbsp; He eventually made choice of
a decayed cab-driver with advanced Radical opinions, who insisted on
a three years&rsquo; contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan worked exceedingly well, and does so, my cousin tells
me, to this day.&nbsp; The drunken father has completely conquered his
dislike to strong drink.&nbsp; He has not been sober now for over three
weeks, and has lately taken to knocking his wife about.&nbsp; The disagreeable
fellow is most conscientious in fulfilling his part of the bargain,
and makes himself a perfect curse to the whole village.&nbsp; The others
have dropped into their respective positions and are working well.&nbsp;
The lady visits them all every afternoon, and is most charitable.&nbsp;
They call her Lady Bountiful, and everybody blesses her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown rose as he finished speaking, and mixed himself a glass of
whisky and water with the self-satisfied air of a benevolent man about
to reward somebody for having done a good deed; and MacShaughnassy lifted
up his voice and talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a story bearing on the subject, too,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It happened in a tiny Yorkshire village&mdash;a peaceful, respectable
spot, where folks found life a bit slow.&nbsp; One day, however, a new
curate arrived, and that woke things up considerably.&nbsp; He was a
nice young man, and, having a large private income of his own, was altogether
a most desirable catch.&nbsp; Every unmarried female in the place went
for him with one accord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ordinary feminine blandishments appeared to have no effect
upon him.&nbsp; He was a seriously inclined young man, and once, in
the course of a casual conversation upon the subject of love, he was
heard to say that he himself should never be attracted by mere beauty
and charm.&nbsp; What would appeal to him, he said, would be a woman&rsquo;s
goodness&mdash;her charity and kindliness to the poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that set the petticoats all thinking.&nbsp; They saw
that in studying fashion plates and practising expressions they had
been going upon the wrong tack.&nbsp; The card for them to play was
&lsquo;the poor.&rsquo;&nbsp; But here a serious difficulty arose.&nbsp;
There was only one poor person in the whole parish, a cantankerous old
fellow who lived in a tumble-down cottage at the back of the church,
and fifteen able-bodied women (eleven girls, three old maids, and a
widow) wanted to be &lsquo;good&rsquo; to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Simmonds, one of the old maids, got hold of him first,
and commenced feeding him twice a day with beef-tea; and then the widow
boarded him with port wine and oysters.&nbsp; Later in the week others
of the party drifted in upon him, and wanted to cram him with jelly
and chickens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; He was accustomed
to a small sack of coals now and then, accompanied by a long lecture
on his sins, and an occasional bottle of dandelion tea.&nbsp; This sudden
spurt on the part of Providence puzzled him.&nbsp; He said nothing,
however, but continued to take in as much of everything as he could
hold.&nbsp; At the end of a month he was too fat to get through his
own back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The competition among the women-folk grew keener every day,
and at last the old man began to give himself airs, and to make the
place hard for them.&nbsp; He made them clean his cottage out, and cook
his meals, and when he was tired of having them about the house, he
set them to work in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They grumbled a good deal, and there was a talk at one time
of a sort of a strike, but what could they do?&nbsp; He was the only
pauper for miles round, and knew it.&nbsp; He had the monopoly, and,
like all monopolises, he abused his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made them run errands.&nbsp; He sent them out to buy his
&lsquo;baccy,&rsquo; at their own expense.&nbsp; On one occasion he
sent Miss Simmonds out with a jug to get his supper beer.&nbsp; She
indignantly refused at first, but he told her that if she gave him any
of her stuck-up airs out she would go, and never come into his house
again.&nbsp; If she wouldn&rsquo;t do it there were plenty of others
who would.&nbsp; She knew it and went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had been in the habit of reading to him&mdash;good books
with an elevating tendency.&nbsp; But now he put his foot down upon
that sort of thing.&nbsp; He said he didn&rsquo;t want Sunday-school
rubbish at his time of life.&nbsp; What he liked was something spicy.&nbsp;
And he made them read him French novels and seafaring tales, containing
realistic language.&nbsp; And they didn&rsquo;t have to skip anything
either, or he&rsquo;d know the reason why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he liked music, so a few of them clubbed together
and bought him a harmonium.&nbsp; Their idea was that they would sing
hymns and play high-class melodies, but it wasn&rsquo;t his.&nbsp; His
idea was&mdash;&lsquo;Keeping up the old girl&rsquo;s birthday&rsquo;
and &lsquo;She winked the other eye,&rsquo; with chorus and skirt dance,
and that&rsquo;s what they sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what lengths his tyranny would have gone it is difficult
to say, had not an event happened that brought his power to a premature
collapse.&nbsp; This was the curate&rsquo;s sudden and somewhat unexpected
marriage with a very beautiful burlesque actress who had lately been
performing in a neighbouring town.&nbsp; He gave up the Church on his
engagement, in consequence of his <i>fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s</i> objection
to becoming a minister&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She said she could never
&lsquo;tumble to&rsquo; the district visiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the curate&rsquo;s wedding the old pauper&rsquo;s brief
career of prosperity ended.&nbsp; They packed him off to the workhouse
after that, and made him break stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>At the end of the telling of his tale, MacShaughnassy lifted his
feet off the mantelpiece, and set to work to wake up his legs; and Jephson
took a hand, and began to spin us stories.</p>
<p>But none of us felt inclined to laugh at Jephson&rsquo;s stories,
for they dealt not with the goodness of the rich to the poor, which
is a virtue yielding quick and highly satisfactory returns, but with
the goodness of the poor to the poor, a somewhat less remunerative investment
and a different matter altogether.</p>
<p>For the poor themselves&mdash;I do not mean the noisy professional
poor, but the silent, fighting poor&mdash;one is bound to feel a genuine
respect.&nbsp; One honours them, as one honours a wounded soldier.</p>
<p>In the perpetual warfare between Humanity and Nature, the poor stand
always in the van.&nbsp; They die in the ditches, and we march over
their bodies with the flags flying and the drums playing.</p>
<p>One cannot think of them without an uncomfortable feeling that one
ought to be a little bit ashamed of living in security and ease, leaving
them to take all the hard blows.&nbsp; It is as if one were always skulking
in the tents, while one&rsquo;s comrades were fighting and dying in
the front.</p>
<p>They bleed and fall in silence there.&nbsp; Nature with her terrible
club, &ldquo;Survival of the Fittest&rdquo;; and Civilisation with her
cruel sword, &ldquo;Supply and Demand,&rdquo; beat them back, and they
give way inch by inch, fighting to the end.&nbsp; But it is in a dumb,
sullen way, that is not sufficiently picturesque to be heroic.</p>
<p>I remember seeing an old bull-dog, one Saturday night, lying on the
doorstep of a small shop in the New Cut.&nbsp; He lay there very quiet,
and seemed a bit sleepy; and, as he looked savage, nobody disturbed
him.&nbsp; People stepped in and out over him, and occasionally in doing
so, one would accidentally kick him, and then he would breathe a little
harder and quicker.</p>
<p>At last a passer-by, feeling something wet beneath his feet, looked
down, and found that he was standing in a pool of blood, and, looking
to see where it came from, found that it flowed in a thick, dark stream
from the step on which the dog was lying.</p>
<p>Then he stooped down and examined the dog, and the dog opened its
eyes sleepily and looked at him, gave a grin which may have implied
pleasure, or may have implied irritation at being disturbed, and died.</p>
<p>A crowd collected, and they turned the dead body of the dog over
on its side, and saw a fearful gash in the groin, out of which oozed
blood, and other things.&nbsp; The proprietor of the shop said the animal
had been there for over an hour.</p>
<p>I have known the poor to die in that same grim, silent way&mdash;not
the poor that you, my delicately-gloved Lady Bountiful and my very excellent
Sir Simon DoGood, know, or that you would care to know; not the poor
who march in processions with banners and collection-boxes; not the
poor that clamour round your soup kitchens and sing hymns at your tea
meetings; but the poor that you don&rsquo;t know are poor until the
tale is told at the coroner&rsquo;s inquest&mdash;the silent, proud
poor who wake each morning to wrestle with Death till night-time, and
who, when at last he overcomes them, and, forcing them down on the rotting
floor of the dim attic, strangles them, still die with their teeth tight
shut.</p>
<p>There was a boy I came to know when I was living in the East End
of London.&nbsp; He was not a nice boy by any means.&nbsp; He was not
quite so clean as are the good boys in the religious magazines, and
I have known a sailor to stop him in the street and reprove him for
using indelicate language.</p>
<p>He and his mother and the baby, a sickly infant of about five months
old, lived in a cellar down a turning off Three Colt Street.&nbsp; I
am not quite sure what had become of the father.&nbsp; I rather think
he had been &ldquo;converted,&rdquo; and had gone off round the country
on a preaching tour.&nbsp; The lad earned six shillings a week as an
errand-boy; and the mother stitched trousers, and on days when she was
feeling strong and energetic would often make as much as tenpence, or
even a shilling.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there were days when the four
bare walls would chase each other round and round, and the candle seem
a faint speck of light, a very long way off; and the frequency of these
caused the family income for the week to occasionally fall somewhat
low.</p>
<p>One night the walls danced round quicker and quicker till they danced
away altogether, and the candle shot up through the ceiling and became
a star and the woman knew that it was time to put away her sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said: she spoke very low, and the boy had
to bend over her to hear, &ldquo;if you poke about in the middle of
the mattress you&rsquo;ll find a couple of pounds.&nbsp; I saved them
up a long while ago.&nbsp; That will pay for burying me.&nbsp; And,
Jim, you&rsquo;ll take care of the kid.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t let it
go to the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;S&rsquo;welp me Gawd,&rsquo; Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;welp me Gawd, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman, having arranged her worldly affairs, lay back ready,
and Death struck.</p>
<p>Jim kept his oath.&nbsp; He found the money, and buried his mother;
and then, putting his household goods on a barrow, moved into cheaper
apartments&mdash;half an old shed, for which he paid two shillings a
week.</p>
<p>For eighteen months he and the baby lived there.&nbsp; He left the
child at a nursery every morning, fetching it away each evening on his
return from work, and for that he paid fourpence a day, which included
a limited supply of milk.&nbsp; How he managed to keep himself and more
than half keep the child on the remaining two shillings I cannot say.&nbsp;
I only know that he did it, and that not a soul ever helped him or knew
that there was help wanted.&nbsp; He nursed the child, often pacing
the room with it for hours, washed it, occasionally, and took it out
for an airing every Sunday.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all which care, the little beggar, at the end of
the time above mentioned, &ldquo;pegged out,&rdquo; to use Jimmy&rsquo;s
own words.</p>
<p>The coroner was very severe on Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you had taken
proper steps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this child&rsquo;s life might have
been preserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He seemed to think it would have been
better if the child&rsquo;s life had been preserved.&nbsp; Coroners
have quaint ideas!)&nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you apply to the relieving
officer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos I didn&rsquo;t want no relief,&rdquo; replied Jim
sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I promised my mother it should never go on the
parish, and it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident occurred, very luckily, during the dead season, and
the evening papers took the case up, and made rather a good thing out
of it.&nbsp; Jim became quite a hero, I remember.&nbsp; Kind-hearted
people wrote, urging that somebody&mdash;the ground landlord, or the
Government, or some one of that sort&mdash;ought to do something for
him.&nbsp; And everybody abused the local vestry.&nbsp; I really think
some benefit to Jim might have come out of it all if only the excitement
had lasted a little longer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, just at its
height a spicy divorce case cropped up, and Jim was crowded out and
forgotten.</p>
<p>I told the boys this story of mine, after Jephson had done telling
his, and, when I had finished, we found it was nearly one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
So, of course, it was too late to do any more work to the novel that
evening.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>We held our next business meeting on my houseboat.&nbsp; Brown was
opposed at first to my going down to this houseboat at all.&nbsp; He
thought that none of us should leave town while the novel was still
on hand.</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy, on the contrary, was of opinion that we should work
better on a houseboat.&nbsp; Speaking for himself, he said he never
felt more like writing a really great work than when lying in a hammock
among whispering leaves, with the deep blue sky above him, and a tumbler
of iced claret cup within easy reach of his hand.&nbsp; Failing a hammock,
he found a deck chair a great incentive to mental labour.&nbsp; In the
interests of the novel, he strongly recommended me to take down with
me at least one comfortable deck chair, and plenty of lemons.</p>
<p>I could not myself see any reason why we should not be able to think
as well on a houseboat as anywhere else, and accordingly it was settled
that I should go down and establish myself upon the thing, and that
the others should visit me there from time to time, when we would sit
round and toil.</p>
<p>This houseboat was Ethelbertha&rsquo;s idea.&nbsp; We had spent a
day, the summer before, on one belonging to a friend of mine, and she
had been enraptured with the life.&nbsp; Everything was on such a delightfully
tiny scale.&nbsp; You lived in a tiny little room; you slept on a tiny
little bed, in a tiny, tiny little bedroom; and you cooked your little
dinner by a tiny little fire, in the tiniest little kitchen that ever
you did see.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it must be lovely, living on a houseboat,&rdquo;
said Ethelbertha, with a gasp of ecstasy; &ldquo;it must be like living
in a doll&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethelbertha was very young&mdash;ridiculously young, as I think I
have mentioned before&mdash;in those days of which I am writing, and
the love of dolls, and of the gorgeous dresses that dolls wear, and
of the many-windowed but inconveniently arranged houses that dolls inhabit&mdash;or
are supposed to inhabit, for as a rule they seem to prefer sitting on
the roof with their legs dangling down over the front door, which has
always appeared to me to be unladylike: but then, of course, I am no
authority on doll etiquette&mdash;had not yet, I think, quite departed
from her.&nbsp; Nay, am I not sure that it had not?&nbsp; Do I not remember,
years later, peeping into a certain room, the walls of which are covered
with works of art of a character calculated to send any &aelig;sthetic
person mad, and seeing her, sitting on the floor, before a red brick
mansion, containing two rooms and a kitchen; and are not her hands trembling
with delight as she arranges the three real tin plates upon the dresser?&nbsp;
And does she not knock at the real brass knocker upon the real front
door until it comes off, and I have to sit down beside her on the floor
and screw it on again?</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, it is unwise for me to recall these things, and
bring them forward thus in evidence against her, for cannot she in turn
laugh at me?&nbsp; Did not I also assist in the arrangement and appointment
of that house beautiful?&nbsp; We differed on the matter of the drawing-room
carpet, I recollect.&nbsp; Ethelbertha fancied a dark blue velvet, but
I felt sure, taking the wall-paper into consideration, that some shade
of terra-cotta would harmonise best.&nbsp; She agreed with me in the
end, and we manufactured one out of an old chest protector.&nbsp; It
had a really charming effect, and gave a delightfully warm tone to the
room.&nbsp; The blue velvet we put in the kitchen.&nbsp; I deemed this
extravagance, but Ethelbertha said that servants thought a lot of a
good carpet, and that it paid to humour them in little things, when
practicable.</p>
<p>The bedroom had one big bed and a cot in it; but I could not see
where the girl was going to sleep.&nbsp; The architect had overlooked
her altogether: that is so like an architect.&nbsp; The house also suffered
from the inconvenience common to residences of its class, of possessing
no stairs, so that to move from one room to another it was necessary
to burst your way up through the ceiling, or else to come outside and
climb in through a window; either of which methods must be fatiguing
when you come to do it often.</p>
<p>Apart from these drawbacks, however, the house was one that any doll
agent would have been justified in describing as a &ldquo;most desirable
family residence&rdquo;; and it had been furnished with a lavishness
that bordered on positive ostentation.&nbsp; In the bedroom there was
a washing-stand, and on the washing-stand there stood a jug and basin,
and in the jug there was real water.&nbsp; But all this was as nothing.&nbsp;
I have known mere ordinary, middle-class dolls&rsquo; houses in which
you might find washing-stands and jugs and basins and real water&mdash;ay,
and even soap.&nbsp; But in this abode of luxury there was a real towel;
so that a body could not only wash himself, but wipe himself afterwards,
and that is a sensation that, as all dolls know, can be enjoyed only
in the very first-class establishments.</p>
<p>Then, in the drawing-room, there was a clock, which would tick just
so long as you continued to shake it (it never seemed to get tired);
also a picture and a piano, and a book upon the table, and a vase of
flowers that would upset the moment you touched it, just like a real
vase of flowers.&nbsp; Oh, there was style about this room, I can tell
you.</p>
<p>But the glory of the house was its kitchen.&nbsp; There were all
things that heart could desire in this kitchen, saucepans with lids
that took on and off, a flat-iron and a rolling-pin.&nbsp; A dinner
service for three occupied about half the room, and what space was left
was filled up by the stove&mdash;a <i>real</i> stove!&nbsp; Think of
it, oh ye owners of dolls&rsquo; houses, a stove in which you could
burn real bits of coal, and on which you could boil real bits of potato
for dinner&mdash;except when people said you mustn&rsquo;t, because
it was dangerous, and took the grate away from you, and blew out the
fire, a thing that hampers a cook.</p>
<p>I never saw a house more complete in all its details.&nbsp; Nothing
had been overlooked, not even the family.&nbsp; It lay on its back,
just outside the front door, proud but calm, waiting to be put into
possession.&nbsp; It was not an extensive family.&nbsp; It consisted
of four&mdash;papa, and mamma, and baby, and the hired girl; just the
family for a beginner.</p>
<p>It was a well-dressed family too&mdash;not merely with grand clothes
outside, covering a shameful condition of things beneath, such as, alas!
is too often the case in doll society, but with every article necessary
and proper to a lady or gentleman, down to items that I could not mention.&nbsp;
And all these garments, you must know, could be unfastened and taken
off.&nbsp; I have known dolls&mdash;stylish enough dolls, to look at,
some of them&mdash;who have been content to go about with their clothes
gummed on to them, and, in some cases, nailed on with tacks, which I
take to be a slovenly and unhealthy habit.&nbsp; But this family could
be undressed in five minutes, without the aid of either hot water or
a chisel.</p>
<p>Not that it was advisable from an artistic point of view that any
of them should.&nbsp; They had not the figure that looks well in its
natural state&mdash;none of them.&nbsp; There was a want of fulness
about them all.&nbsp; Besides, without their clothes, it might have
been difficult to distinguish the baby from the papa, or the maid from
the mistress, and thus domestic complications might have arisen.</p>
<p>When all was ready for their reception we established them in their
home.&nbsp; We put as much of the baby to bed as the cot would hold,
and made the papa and mamma comfortable in the drawing-room, where they
sat on the floor and stared thoughtfully at each other across the table.&nbsp;
(They had to sit on the floor because the chairs were not big enough.)&nbsp;
The girl we placed in the kitchen, where she leant against the dresser
in an attitude suggestive of drink, embracing the broom we had given
her with maudlin affection.&nbsp; Then we lifted up the house with care,
and carried it cautiously into another room, and with the deftness of
experienced conspirators placed it at the foot of a small bed, on the
south-west corner of which an absurdly small somebody had hung an absurdly
small stocking.</p>
<p>To return to our own doll&rsquo;s house, Ethelbertha and I, discussing
the subject during our return journey in the train, resolved that, next
year, we ourselves would possess a houseboat, a smaller houseboat, if
possible, than even the one we had just seen.&nbsp; It should have art-muslin
curtains and a flag, and the flowers about it should be wild roses and
forget-me-nots.&nbsp; I could work all the morning on the roof, with
an awning over me to keep off the sun, while Ethelbertha trimmed the
roses and made cakes for tea; and in the evenings we would sit out on
the little deck, and Ethelbertha would play the guitar (she would begin
learning it at once), or we could sit quiet and listen to the nightingales.</p>
<p>For, when you are very, very young you dream that the summer is all
sunny days and moonlight nights, that the wind blows always softly from
the west, and that roses will thrive anywhere.&nbsp; But, as you grow
older, you grow tired of waiting for the gray sky to break.&nbsp; So
you close the door and come in, and crouch over the fire, wondering
why the winds blow ever from the east: and you have given up trying
to rear roses.</p>
<p>I knew a little cottage girl who saved up her money for months and
months so as to buy a new frock in which to go to a flower-show.&nbsp;
But the day of the flower-show was a wet day, so she wore an old frock
instead.&nbsp; And all the f&ecirc;te days for quite a long while were
wet days, and she feared she would never have a chance of wearing her
pretty white dress.&nbsp; But at last there came a f&ecirc;te day morning
that was bright and sunny, and then the little girl clapped her hands
and ran upstairs, and took her new frock (which had been her &ldquo;new
frock&rdquo; for so long a time that it was now the oldest frock she
had) from the box where it lay neatly folded between lavender and thyme,
and held it up, and laughed to think how nice she would look in it.</p>
<p>But when she went to put it on, she found that she had out-grown
it, and that it was too small for her every way.&nbsp; So she had to
wear a common old frock after all.</p>
<p>Things happen that way, you know, in this world.&nbsp; There were
a boy and girl once who loved each other very dearly.&nbsp; But they
were both poor, so they agreed to wait till he had made enough money
for them to live comfortably upon, and then they would marry and be
happy.&nbsp; It took him a long while to make, because making money
is very slow work, and he wanted, while he was about it, to make enough
for them to be very happy upon indeed.&nbsp; He accomplished the task
eventually, however, and came back home a wealthy man.</p>
<p>Then they met again in the poorly-furnished parlour where they had
parted.&nbsp; But they did not sit as near to each other as of old.&nbsp;
For she had lived alone so long that she had grown old-maidish, and
she was feeling vexed with him for having dirtied the carpet with his
muddy boots.&nbsp; And he had worked so long earning money that he had
grown hard and cold like the money itself, and was trying to think of
something affectionate to say to her.</p>
<p>So for a while they sat, one each side of the paper &ldquo;fire-stove
ornament,&rdquo; both wondering why they had shed such scalding tears
on that day they had kissed each other good-bye; then said &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo;
again, and were glad.</p>
<p>There is another tale with much the same moral that I learnt at school
out of a copy-book.&nbsp; If I remember rightly, it runs somewhat like
this:&mdash;</p>
<p>Once upon a time there lived a wise grasshopper and a foolish ant.&nbsp;
All through the pleasant summer weather the grasshopper sported and
played, gambolling with his fellows in and out among the sun-beams,
dining sumptuously each day on leaves and dew-drops, never troubling
about the morrow, singing ever his one peaceful, droning song.</p>
<p>But there came the cruel winter, and the grasshopper, looking around,
saw that his friends, the flowers, lay dead, and knew thereby that his
own little span was drawing near its close.</p>
<p>Then he felt glad that he had been so happy, and had not wasted his
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been very short,&rdquo; said he to himself;
&ldquo;but it has been very pleasant, and I think I have made the best
use of it.&nbsp; I have drunk in the sunshine, I have lain on the soft,
warm air, I have played merry games in the waving grass, I have tasted
the juice of the sweet green leaves.&nbsp; I have done what I could.&nbsp;
I have spread my wings, I have sung my song.&nbsp; Now I will thank
God for the sunny days that are passed, and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying which, he crawled under a brown leaf, and met his fate in
the way that all brave grasshoppers should; and a little bird that was
passing by picked him up tenderly and buried him.</p>
<p>Now when the foolish ant saw this, she was greatly puffed up with
Pharisaical conceit.&nbsp; &ldquo;How thankful I ought to be,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;that I am industrious and prudent, and not like this
poor grasshopper.&nbsp; While he was flitting about from flower to flower,
enjoying himself, I was hard at work, putting by against the winter.&nbsp;
Now he is dead, while I am about to make myself cosy in my warm home,
and eat all the good things that I have been saving up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as she spoke, the gardener came along with his spade, and levelled
the hill where she dwelt to the ground, and left her lying dead amidst
the ruins.</p>
<p>Then the same kind little bird that had buried the grasshopper came
and picked her out and buried her also; and afterwards he composed and
sang a song, the burthen of which was, &ldquo;Gather ye rosebuds while
ye may.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a very pretty song, and a very wise song,
and a man who lived in those days, and to whom the birds, loving him
and feeling that he was almost one of themselves, had taught their language,
fortunately overheard it and wrote it down, so that all may read it
to this day.</p>
<p>Unhappily for us, however, Fate is a harsh governess, who has no
sympathy with our desire for rosebuds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop
to pick flowers now, my dear,&rdquo; she cries, in her sharp, cross
tones, as she seizes our arm and jerks us back into the roadway; &ldquo;we
haven&rsquo;t time to-day.&nbsp; We will come back again to-morrow,
and you shall pick them then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we have to follow her, knowing, if we are experienced children,
that the chances are that we shall never come that way to-morrow; or
that, if we do, the roses will be dead.</p>
<p>Fate would not hear of our having a houseboat that summer,&mdash;which
was an exceptionally fine summer,&mdash;but promised us that if we were
good and saved up our money, we should have one next year; and Ethelbertha
and I, being simple-minded, inexperienced children, were content with
the promise, and had faith in its satisfactory fulfilment.</p>
<p>As soon as we reached home we informed Amenda of our plan.&nbsp;
The moment the girl opened the door, Ethelbertha burst out with:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!
can you swim, Amenda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mum,&rdquo; answered Amenda, with entire absence of curiosity
as to why such a question had been addressed to her, &ldquo;I never
knew but one girl as could, and she got drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to make haste and learn, then,&rdquo;
continued Ethelbertha, &ldquo;because you won&rsquo;t be able to walk
out with your young man, you&rsquo;ll have to swim out.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
not going to live in a house any more.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to live
on a boat in the middle of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethelbertha&rsquo;s chief object in life at this period was to surprise
and shock Amenda, and her chief sorrow that she had never succeeded
in doing so.&nbsp; She had hoped great things from this announcement,
but the girl remained unmoved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, are you, mum,&rdquo;
she replied; and went on to speak of other matters.</p>
<p>I believe the result would have been the same if we had told her
we were going to live in a balloon.</p>
<p>I do not know how it was, I am sure.&nbsp; Amenda was always most
respectful in her manner.&nbsp; But she had a knack of making Ethelbertha
and myself feel that we were a couple of children, playing at being
grown up and married, and that she was humouring us.</p>
<p>Amenda stayed with us for nearly five years&mdash;until the milkman,
having saved up sufficient to buy a &ldquo;walk&rdquo; of his own, had
become practicable&mdash;but her attitude towards us never changed.&nbsp;
Even when we came to be really important married people, the proprietors
of a &ldquo;family,&rdquo; it was evident that she merely considered
we had gone a step further in the game, and were playing now at being
fathers and mothers.</p>
<p>By some subtle process she contrived to imbue the baby also with
this idea.&nbsp; The child never seemed to me to take either of us quite
seriously.&nbsp; She would play with us, or join with us in light conversation;
but when it came to the serious affairs of life, such as bathing or
feeding, she preferred her nurse.</p>
<p>Ethelbertha attempted to take her out in the perambulator one morning,
but the child would not hear of it for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, baby dear,&rdquo; explained Ethelbertha
soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Baby&rsquo;s going out with mamma this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, baby ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was baby&rsquo;s rejoinder,
in effect if not in words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Baby don&rsquo;t take a hand
in experiments&mdash;not this baby.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be upset
or run over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Ethel!&nbsp; I shall never forget how heart-broken she was.&nbsp;
It was the want of confidence that wounded her.</p>
<p>But these are reminiscences of other days, having no connection with
the days of which I am&mdash;or should be&mdash;writing; and to wander
from one matter to another is, in a teller of tales, a grievous sin,
and a growing custom much to be condemned.&nbsp; Therefore I will close
my eyes to all other memories, and endeavour to see only that little
white and green houseboat by the ferry, which was the scene of our future
collaborations.</p>
<p>Houseboats then were not built to the scale of Mississippi steamers,
but this boat was a small one, even for that primitive age.&nbsp; The
man from whom we hired it described it as &ldquo;compact.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The man to whom, at the end of the first month, we tried to sub-let
it, characterised it as &ldquo;poky.&rdquo;&nbsp; In our letters we
traversed this definition.&nbsp; In our hearts we agreed with it.</p>
<p>At first, however, its size&mdash;or, rather, its lack of size&mdash;was
one of its chief charms in Ethelbertha&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The fact
that if you got out of bed carelessly you were certain to knock your
head against the ceiling, and that it was utterly impossible for any
man to put on his trousers except in the saloon, she regarded as a capital
joke.</p>
<p>That she herself had to take a looking-glass and go upon the roof
to do her back hair, she thought less amusing.</p>
<p>Amenda accepted her new surroundings with her usual philosophic indifference.&nbsp;
On being informed that what she had mistaken for a linen-press was her
bedroom, she remarked that there was one advantage about it, and that
was, that she could not tumble out of bed, seeing there was nowhere
to tumble; and, on being shown the kitchen, she observed that she should
like it for two things&mdash;one was that she could sit in the middle
and reach everything without getting up; the other, that nobody else
could come into the apartment while she was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Amenda,&rdquo; explained Ethelbertha apologetically,
&ldquo;we shall really live outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum,&rdquo; answered Amenda, &ldquo;I should say that
would be the best place to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If only we could have lived more outside, the life might have been
pleasant enough, but the weather rendered it impossible, six days out
of the seven, for us to do more than look out of the window and feel
thankful that we had a roof over our heads.</p>
<p>I have known wet summers before and since.&nbsp; I have learnt by
many bitter experiences the danger and foolishness of leaving the shelter
of London any time between the first of May and the thirty-first of
October.&nbsp; Indeed, the country is always associate in my mind with
recollections of long, weary days passed in the pitiless rain, and sad
evenings spent in other people&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp; But never have
I known, and never, I pray night and morning, may I know again, such
a summer as the one we lived through (though none of us expected to)
on that confounded houseboat.</p>
<p>In the morning we would be awakened by the rain&rsquo;s forcing its
way through the window and wetting the bed, and would get up and mop
out the saloon.&nbsp; After breakfast I would try to work, but the beating
of the hail upon the roof just over my head would drive every idea out
of my brain, and, after a wasted hour or two, I would fling down my
pen and hunt up Ethelbertha, and we would put on our mackintoshes and
take our umbrellas and go out for a row.&nbsp; At mid-day we would return
and put on some dry clothes, and sit down to dinner.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the storm generally freshened up a bit, and we were
kept pretty busy rushing about with towels and cloths, trying to prevent
the water from coming into the rooms and swamping us.&nbsp; During tea-time
the saloon was usually illuminated by forked lightning.&nbsp; The evenings
we spent in baling out the boat, after which we took it in turns to
go into the kitchen and warm ourselves.&nbsp; At eight we supped, and
from then until it was time to go to bed we sat wrapped up in rugs,
listening to the roaring of the thunder, and the howling of the wind,
and the lashing of the waves, and wondering whether the boat would hold
out through the night.</p>
<p>Friends would come down to spend the day with us&mdash;elderly, irritable
people, fond of warmth and comfort; people who did not, as a rule, hanker
after jaunts, even under the most favourable conditions; but who had
been persuaded by our silly talk that a day on the river would be to
them like a Saturday to Monday in Paradise.</p>
<p>They would arrive soaked; and we would shut them up in different
bunks, and leave them to strip themselves and put on things of Ethelbertha&rsquo;s
or of mine.&nbsp; But Ethel and I, in those days, were slim, so that
stout, middle-aged people in our clothes neither looked well nor felt
happy.</p>
<p>Upon their emerging we would take them into the saloon and try to
entertain them by telling them what we had intended to do with them
had the day been fine.&nbsp; But their answers were short, and occasionally
snappy, and after a while the conversation would flag, and we would
sit round reading last week&rsquo;s newspapers and coughing.</p>
<p>The moment their own clothes were dry (we lived in a perpetual atmosphere
of steaming clothes) they would insist upon leaving us, which seemed
to me discourteous after all that we had done for them, and would dress
themselves once more and start off home, and get wet again before they
got there.</p>
<p>We would generally receive a letter a few days afterwards, written
by some relative, informing us that both patients were doing as well
as could be expected, and promising to send us a card for the funeral
in case of a relapse.</p>
<p>Our chief recreation, our sole consolation, during the long weeks
of our imprisonment, was to watch from our windows the pleasure-seekers
passing by in small open boats, and to reflect what an awful day they
had had, or were going to have, as the case might be.</p>
<p>In the forenoon they would head up stream&mdash;young men with their
sweethearts; nephews taking out their rich old aunts; husbands and wives
(some of them pairs, some of them odd ones); stylish-looking girls with
cousins; energetic-looking men with dogs; high-class silent parties;
low-class noisy parties; quarrelsome family parties&mdash;boatload after
boatload they went by, wet, but still hopeful, pointing out bits of
blue sky to each other.</p>
<p>In the evening they would return, drenched and gloomy, saying disagreeable
things to one another.</p>
<p>One couple, and one couple only, out of the many hundreds that passed
under our review, came back from the ordeal with pleasant faces.&nbsp;
He was rowing hard and singing, with a handkerchief tied round his head
to keep his hat on, and she was laughing at him, while trying to hold
up an umbrella with one hand and steer with the other.</p>
<p>There are but two explanations to account for people being jolly
on the river in the rain.&nbsp; The one I dismissed as being both uncharitable
and improbable.&nbsp; The other was creditable to the human race, and,
adopting it, I took off my cap to this damp but cheerful pair as they
went by.&nbsp; They answered with a wave of the hand, and I stood looking
after them till they disappeared in the mist.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that those young people, if they be still
alive, are happy.&nbsp; Maybe, fortune has been kind to them, or maybe
she has not, but in either event they are, I am inclined to think, happier
than are most people.</p>
<p>Now and again, the daily tornado would rage with such fury as to
defeat its own purpose by prematurely exhausting itself.&nbsp; On these
rare occasions we would sit out on the deck, and enjoy the unwonted
luxury of fresh air.</p>
<p>I remember well those few pleasant evenings: the river, luminous
with the drowned light, the dark banks where the night lurked, the storm-tossed
sky, jewelled here and there with stars.</p>
<p>It was delightful not to hear for an hour or so the sullen thrashing
of the rain; but to listen to the leaping of the fishes, the soft swirl
raised by some water-rat, swimming stealthily among the rushes, the
restless twitterings of the few still wakeful birds.</p>
<p>An old corncrake lived near to us, and the way he used to disturb
all the other birds, and keep them from going to sleep, was shameful.&nbsp;
Amenda, who was town-bred, mistook him at first for one of those cheap
alarm clocks, and wondered who was winding him up, and why they went
on doing it all night; and, above all, why they didn&rsquo;t oil him.</p>
<p>He would begin his unhallowed performance about dusk, just as every
respectable bird was preparing to settle down for the night.&nbsp; A
family of thrushes had their nest a few yards from his stand, and they
used to get perfectly furious with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that fool at it again,&rdquo; the female thrush
would say; &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t he do it in the daytime if he must
do it at all?&rdquo;&nbsp; (She spoke, of course, in twitters, but I
am confident the above is a correct translation.)</p>
<p>After a while, the young thrushes would wake up and begin chirping,
and then the mother would get madder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you say something to him?&rdquo; she would cry
indignantly to her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you think the children
can get to sleep, poor things, with that hideous row going on all night?&nbsp;
Might just as well be living in a saw-mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, the male thrush would put his head over the nest, and
call out in a nervous, apologetic manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you know, you there, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
being quiet a bit.&nbsp; My wife says she can&rsquo;t get the children
to sleep.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too bad, you know, &rsquo;pon my word it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gor on,&rdquo; the corncrake would answer surlily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
keep your wife herself quiet; that&rsquo;s enough for you to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And on he would go again worse than before.</p>
<p>Then a mother blackbird, from a little further off, would join in
the fray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a good hiding he wants, not a talking to.&nbsp;
And if I was a cock, I&rsquo;d give it him.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This remark
would be made in a tone of withering contempt, and would appear to bear
reference to some previous discussion.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Mrs. Thrush
would reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I tell my husband, but&rdquo;
(with rising inflection, so that every lady in the plantation might
hear) &ldquo;<i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t move himself, bless you&mdash;no,
not if I and the children were to die before his eyes for want of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he ain&rsquo;t the only one, my dear,&rdquo; the blackbird
would pipe back, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all alike&rdquo;; then, in a voice
more of sorrow than of anger:&mdash;&ldquo;but there, it ain&rsquo;t
their fault, I suppose, poor things.&nbsp; If you ain&rsquo;t got the
spirit of a bird you can&rsquo;t help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would strain my ears at this point to hear if the male blackbird
was moved at all by these taunts, but the only sound I could ever detect
coming from his neighbourhood was that of palpably exaggerated snoring.</p>
<p>By this time the whole glade would be awake, expressing views concerning
that corncrake that would have wounded a less callous nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow me tight, Bill,&rdquo; some vulgar little hedge-sparrow
would chirp out, in the midst of the hubbub, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t
believe the gent thinks &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a-singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t &rsquo;is fault,&rdquo; Bill would reply,
with mock sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s put a penny in the
slot, and &rsquo;e can&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;isself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irritated by the laugh that this would call forth from the younger
birds, the corncrake would exert himself to be more objectionable than
ever, and, as a means to this end, would commence giving his marvellous
imitation of the sharpening of a rusty saw by a steel file.</p>
<p>But at this an old crow, not to be trifled with, would cry out angrily:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, now.&nbsp; If I come down to you I&rsquo;ll peck
your cranky head off, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then would follow silence for a quarter of an hour, after which
the whole thing would begin again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>Brown and MacShaughnassy came down together on the Saturday afternoon;
and, as soon as they had dried themselves, and had had some tea, we
settled down to work.</p>
<p>Jephson had written that he would not be able to be with us until
late in the evening, and Brown proposed that we should occupy ourselves
until his arrival with plots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let each of us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sketch out a plot.&nbsp;
Afterwards we can compare them, and select the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This we proceeded to do.&nbsp; The plots themselves I forget, but
I remember that at the subsequent judging each man selected his own,
and became so indignant at the bitter criticism to which it was subjected
by the other two, that he tore it up; and, for the next half-hour, we
sat and smoked in silence.</p>
<p>When I was very young I yearned to know other people&rsquo;s opinion
of me and all my works; now, my chief aim is to avoid hearing it.&nbsp;
In those days, had any one told me there was half a line about myself
in a newspaper, I should have tramped London to obtain that publication.&nbsp;
Now, when I see a column headed with my name, I hurriedly fold up the
paper and put it away from me, subduing my natural curiosity to read
it by saying to myself, &ldquo;Why should you?&nbsp; It will only upset
you for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my cubhood I possessed a friend.&nbsp; Other friends have come
into my life since&mdash;very dear and precious friends&mdash;but they
have none of them been to me quite what this friend was.&nbsp; Because
he was my first friend, and we lived together in a world that was much
bigger than this world&mdash;more full of joy and of grief; and, in
that world, we loved and hated deeper than we love and hate in this
smaller world that I have come to dwell in since.</p>
<p>He also had the very young man&rsquo;s craving to be criticised,
and we made it our custom to oblige each other.&nbsp; We did not know
then that what we meant, when we asked for &ldquo;criticism,&rdquo;
was encouragement.&nbsp; We thought that we were strong&mdash;one does
at the beginning of the battle, and that we could bear to hear the truth.</p>
<p>Accordingly, each one pointed out to the other one his errors, and
this task kept us both so busy that we had never time to say a word
of praise to one another.&nbsp; That we each had a high opinion of the
other&rsquo;s talents I am convinced, but our heads were full of silly
saws.&nbsp; We said to ourselves: &ldquo;There are many who will praise
a man; it is only his friend who will tell him of his faults.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Also, we said: &ldquo;No man sees his own shortcomings, but when these
are pointed out to him by another he is grateful, and proceeds to mend
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we came to know the world better, we learnt the fallacy of these
ideas.&nbsp; But then it was too late, for the mischief had been done.</p>
<p>When one of us had written anything, he would read it to the other,
and when he had finished he would say, &ldquo;Now, tell me what you
think of it&mdash;frankly and as a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were his words.&nbsp; But his thoughts, though he may not have
known them, were:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me it is clever and good, my friend, even if you do not
think so.&nbsp; The world is very cruel to those that have not yet conquered
it, and, though we keep a careless face, our young hearts are scored
with wrinkles.&nbsp; Often we grow weary and faint-hearted.&nbsp; Is
it not so, my friend?&nbsp; No one has faith in us, and in our dark
hours we doubt ourselves.&nbsp; You are my comrade.&nbsp; You know what
of myself I have put into this thing that to others will be but an idle
half-hour&rsquo;s reading.&nbsp; Tell me it is good, my friend.&nbsp;
Put a little heart into me, I pray you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other, full of the lust of criticism, which is civilisation&rsquo;s
substitute for cruelty, would answer more in frankness than in friendship.&nbsp;
Then he who had written would flush angrily, and scornful words would
pass.</p>
<p>One evening, he read me a play he had written.&nbsp; There was much
that was good in it, but there were also faults (there are in some plays),
and these I seized upon and made merry over.&nbsp; I could hardly have
dealt out to the piece more unnecessary bitterness had I been a professional
critic.</p>
<p>As soon as I paused from my sport he rose, and, taking his manuscript
from the table, tore it in two, and flung it in the fire&mdash;he was
but a very young man, you must remember&mdash;and then, standing before
me with a white face, told me, unsolicited, his opinion of me and of
my art.&nbsp; After which double event, it is perhaps needless to say
that we parted in hot anger.</p>
<p>I did not see him again for years.&nbsp; The streets of life are
very crowded, and if we loose each other&rsquo;s hands we are soon hustled
far apart.&nbsp; When I did next meet him it was by accident.</p>
<p>I had left the Whitehall Rooms after a public dinner, and, glad of
the cool night air, was strolling home by the Embankment.&nbsp; A man,
slouching along under the trees, paused as I overtook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t oblige me with a light, could you, guv&rsquo;nor?&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; The voice sounded strange, coming from the figure that
it did.</p>
<p>I struck a match, and held it out to him, shaded by my hands.&nbsp;
As the faint light illumined his face, I started back, and let the match
fall:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered with a short dry laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
it was you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or I shouldn&rsquo;t have stopped
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How has it come to this, old fellow?&rdquo; I asked, laying
my hand upon his shoulder.&nbsp; His coat was unpleasantly greasy, and
I drew my hand away again as quickly as I could, and tried to wipe it
covertly upon my handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long, story,&rdquo; he answered carelessly,
&ldquo;and too conventional to be worth telling.&nbsp; Some of us go
up, you know.&nbsp; Some of us go down.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re doing pretty
well, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve climbed
a few feet up a greasy pole, and am trying to stick there.&nbsp; But
it is of you I want to talk.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were passing under a gas-lamp at the moment.&nbsp; He thrust his
face forward close to mine, and the light fell full and pitilessly upon
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a man you could do anything for?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>We walked on in silence side by side, I casting about for words that
might seize hold of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; he continued after
a while, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comfortable enough.&nbsp; We take life easily
down here where I am.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve no disappointments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you give up like a weak coward?&rdquo; I burst out
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had talent.&nbsp; You would have won with
ordinary perseverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he replied, in the same even tone of indifference.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose I hadn&rsquo;t the grit.&nbsp; I think if somebody
had believed in me it might have helped me.&nbsp; But nobody did, and
at last I lost belief in myself.&nbsp; And when a man loses that, he&rsquo;s
like a balloon with the gas let out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened to his words in indignation and astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody
believed in you!&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, <i>I</i> always
believed in you, you know that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I paused, remembering our &ldquo;candid criticism&rdquo; of
one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; he replied quietly, &ldquo;I never heard you
say so.&nbsp; Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of our Strandward walking we had come to the neighbourhood
of the Savoy, and, as he spoke, he disappeared down one of the dark
turnings thereabouts.</p>
<p>I hastened after him, calling him by name, but though I heard his
quick steps before me for a little way, they were soon swallowed up
in the sound of other steps, and, when I reached the square in which
the chapel stands, I had lost all trace of him.</p>
<p>A policeman was standing by the churchyard railings, and of him I
made inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a gent was he, sir?&rdquo; questioned the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall thin gentleman, very shabbily dressed&mdash;might be
mistaken for a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s a good many of that sort living in this
town,&rdquo; replied the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll
have some difficulty in finding him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus for a second time had I heard his footsteps die away, knowing
I should never listen for their drawing near again.</p>
<p>I wondered as I walked on&mdash;I have wondered before and since&mdash;whether
Art, even with a capital A, is quite worth all the suffering that is
inflicted in her behalf&mdash;whether she and we are better for all
the scorning and the sneering, all the envying and the hating, that
is done in her name.</p>
<p>Jephson arrived about nine o&rsquo;clock in the ferry-boat.&nbsp;
We were made acquainted with this fact by having our heads bumped against
the sides of the saloon.</p>
<p>Somebody or other always had their head bumped whenever the ferry-boat
arrived.&nbsp; It was a heavy and cumbersome machine, and the ferry-boy
was not a good punter.&nbsp; He admitted this frankly, which was creditable
of him.&nbsp; But he made no attempt to improve himself; that is, where
he was wrong.&nbsp; His method was to arrange the punt before starting
in a line with the point towards which he wished to proceed, and then
to push hard, without ever looking behind him, until something suddenly
stopped him.&nbsp; This was sometimes the bank, sometimes another boat,
occasionally a steamer, from six to a dozen times a day our riparian
dwelling.&nbsp; That he never succeeded in staving the houseboat in
speaks highly for the man who built her.</p>
<p>One day he came down upon us with a tremendous crash.&nbsp; Amenda
was walking along the passage at the moment, and the result to her was
that she received a violent blow first on the left side of her head
and then on the right.</p>
<p>She was accustomed to accept one bump as a matter of course, and
to regard it as an intimation from the boy that he had come; but this
double knock annoyed her: so much &ldquo;style&rdquo; was out of place
in a mere ferry-boy.&nbsp; Accordingly she went out to him in a state
of high indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you are?&rdquo; she cried, balancing accounts
by boxing his ears first on one side and then on the other, &ldquo;a
torpedo!&nbsp; What are you doing here at all?&nbsp; What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; explained the boy,
rubbing his head; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought a gent down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gent?&rdquo; said Amenda, looking round, but seeing no one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What gent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stout gent in a straw &rsquo;at,&rdquo; answered the boy,
staring round him bewilderedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is he?&rdquo; asked Amenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied the boy, in an awed voice; &ldquo;&rsquo;e
was a-standin&rsquo; there, at the other end of the punt, a-smokin&rsquo;
a cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a head appeared above the water, and a spent but infuriated
swimmer struggled up between the houseboat and the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there &rsquo;e is!&rdquo; cried the boy delightedly, evidently
much relieved at this satisfactory solution of the mystery; &ldquo;&rsquo;e
must ha&rsquo; tumbled off the punt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, my lad, that&rsquo;s just what he
did do, and there&rsquo;s your fee for assisting him to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Saying which, my dripping friend, who had now scrambled upon deck, leant
over, and following Amenda&rsquo;s excellent example, expressed his
feelings upon the boy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>There was one comforting reflection about the transaction as a whole,
and that was that the ferry-boy had at last received a fit and proper
reward for his services.&nbsp; I had often felt inclined to give him
something myself.&nbsp; I think he was, without exception, the most
clumsy and stupid boy I have ever come across; and that is saying a
good deal.</p>
<p>His mother undertook that for three-and-sixpence a week he should
&ldquo;make himself generally useful&rdquo; to us for a couple of hours
every morning.</p>
<p>Those were the old lady&rsquo;s very words, and I repeated them to
Amenda when I introduced the boy to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is James, Amenda,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;he will come
down here every morning at seven, and bring us our milk and the letters,
and from then till nine he will make himself generally useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amenda took stock of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a change of occupation for him, sir, I should say,
by the look of him,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>After that, whenever some more than usually stirring crash or blood-curdling
bump would cause us to leap from our seats and cry: &ldquo;What on earth
has happened?&rdquo;&nbsp; Amenda would reply: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s
only James, mum, making himself generally useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever he lifted he let fall; whatever he touched he upset; whatever
he came near&mdash;that was not a fixture&mdash;he knocked over; if
it was a fixture, it knocked <i>him</i> over.&nbsp; This was not carelessness:
it seemed to be a natural gift.&nbsp; Never in his life, I am convinced,
had he carried a bucketful of anything anywhere without tumbling over
it before he got there.&nbsp; One of his duties was to water the flowers
on the roof.&nbsp; Fortunately&mdash;for the flowers&mdash;Nature, that
summer, stood drinks with a lavishness sufficient to satisfy the most
confirmed vegetable toper: otherwise every plant on our boat would have
died from drought.&nbsp; Never one drop of water did they receive from
him.&nbsp; He was for ever taking them water, but he never arrived there
with it.&nbsp; As a rule he upset the pail before he got it on to the
boat at all, and this was the best thing that could happen, because
then the water simply went back into the river, and did no harm to any
one.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, he would succeed in landing it, and then
the chances were he would spill it over the deck or into the passage.&nbsp;
Now and again, he would get half-way up the ladder before the accident
occurred.&nbsp; Twice he nearly reached the top; and once he actually
did gain the roof.&nbsp; What happened there on that memorable occasion
will never be known.&nbsp; The boy himself, when picked up, could explain
nothing.&nbsp; It is supposed that he lost his head with the pride of
the achievement, and essayed feats that neither his previous training
nor his natural abilities justified him in attempting.&nbsp; However
that may be, the fact remains that the main body of the water came down
the kitchen chimney; and that the boy and the empty pail arrived together
on deck before they knew they had started.</p>
<p>When he could find nothing else to damage, he would go out of his
way to upset himself.&nbsp; He could not be sure of stepping from his
own punt on to the boat with safety.&nbsp; As often as not, he would
catch his foot in the chain or the punt-pole, and arrive on his chest.</p>
<p>Amenda used to condole with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother ought to
be ashamed of herself,&rdquo; I heard her telling him one morning; &ldquo;she
could never have taught you to walk.&nbsp; What you want is a go-cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a willing lad, but his stupidity was super-natural.&nbsp;
A comet appeared in the sky that year, and everybody was talking about
it.&nbsp; One day he said to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a comet coming, ain&rsquo;t there, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He talked about it as though it were a circus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s come.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t
you seen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you have a look for it to-night.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yees, sir, I should like to see it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got a
tail, ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a very fine tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yees, sir, they said it &rsquo;ad a tail.&nbsp; Where do you
go to see it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
see it in your own garden at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thanked me, and, tumbling over a sack of potatoes, plunged head
foremost into his punt and departed.</p>
<p>Next morning, I asked him if he had seen the comet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t see it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yees, sir.&nbsp; I looked a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth did you manage to miss it then?&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was a clear enough night.&nbsp; Where did you look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our garden, sir.&nbsp; Where you told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts in the garden?&rdquo; chimed in Amenda, who happened
to be standing by; &ldquo;under the gooseberry bushes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yees&mdash;everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is what he had done: he had taken the stable lantern and searched
the garden for it.</p>
<p>But the day when he broke even his own record for foolishness happened
about three weeks later.&nbsp; MacShaughnassy was staying with us at
the time, and on the Friday evening he mixed us a salad, according to
a recipe given him by his aunt.&nbsp; On the Saturday morning, everybody
was, of course, very ill.&nbsp; Everybody always is very ill after partaking
of any dish prepared by MacShaughnassy.&nbsp; Some people attempt to
explain this fact by talking glibly of &ldquo;cause and effect.&rdquo;&nbsp;
MacShaughnassy maintains that it is simply coincidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t
have been ill if you hadn&rsquo;t eaten any?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re queer
enough now, any one can see, and I&rsquo;m very sorry for you; but,
for all that you can tell, if you hadn&rsquo;t eaten any of that stuff
you might have been very much worse&mdash;perhaps dead.&nbsp; In all
probability, it has saved your life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And for the rest of
the day, he assumes towards you the attitude of a man who has dragged
you from the grave.</p>
<p>The moment Jimmy arrived I seized hold of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you must rush off to the chemist&rsquo;s
immediately.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stop for anything.&nbsp; Tell him to
give you something for colic&mdash;the result of vegetable poisoning.&nbsp;
It must be something very strong, and enough for four.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
forget, something to counteract the effects of vegetable poisoning.&nbsp;
Hurry up, or it may be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My excitement communicated itself to the boy.&nbsp; He tumbled back
into his punt, and pushed off vigorously.&nbsp; I watched him land,
and disappear in the direction of the village.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, but Jimmy did not return.&nbsp; No one felt
sufficiently energetic to go after him.&nbsp; We had only just strength
enough to sit still and feebly abuse him.&nbsp; At the end of an hour
we were all feeling very much better.&nbsp; At the end of an hour and
a half we were glad he had not returned when he ought to have, and were
only curious as to what had become of him.</p>
<p>In the evening, strolling through the village, we saw him sitting
by the open door of his mother&rsquo;s cottage, with a shawl wrapped
round him.&nbsp; He was looking worn and ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jimmy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t you come back this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; Jimmy answered, &ldquo;I was
so queer.&nbsp; Mother made me go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seemed all right in the morning,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
made you queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mr. Jones give me, sir: it upset me awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light broke in upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Jimmy, when you got to Mr. Jones&rsquo;s
shop?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;im what you said, sir, that &rsquo;e was to
give me something to counteract the effects of vegetable poisoning.&nbsp;
And that it was to be very strong, and enough for four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E said that was only your nonsense, sir, and that I&rsquo;d
better have enough for one to begin with; and then &rsquo;e asked me
if I&rsquo;d been eating green apples again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you told him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yees, sir, I told &rsquo;im I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad a few, and
&rsquo;e said it served me right, and that &rsquo;e &rsquo;oped it would
be a warning to me.&nbsp; And then &rsquo;e put something fizzy in a
glass and told me to drink it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you drank it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yees, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never occurred to you, Jimmy, that there was nothing the
matter with you&mdash;that you were never feeling better in your life,
and that you did not require any medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did one single scintilla of thought of any kind occur to you
in connection with the matter, Jimmy, from beginning to end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People who never met Jimmy disbelieve this story.&nbsp; They argue
that its premises are in disaccord with the known laws governing human
nature, that its details do not square with the average of probability.&nbsp;
People who have seen and conversed with Jimmy accept it with simple
faith.</p>
<p>The advent of Jephson&mdash;which I trust the reader has not entirely
forgotten&mdash;cheered us up considerably.&nbsp; Jephson was always
at his best when all other things were at their worst.&nbsp; It was
not that he struggled in Mark Tapley fashion to appear most cheerful
when most depressed; it was that petty misfortunes and mishaps genuinely
amused and inspirited him.&nbsp; Most of us can recall our unpleasant
experiences with amused affection; Jephson possessed the robuster philosophy
that enabled him to enjoy his during their actual progress.&nbsp; He
arrived drenched to the skin, chuckling hugely at the idea of having
come down on a visit to a houseboat in such weather.</p>
<p>Under his warming influence, the hard lines on our faces thawed,
and by supper time we were, as all Englishmen and women who wish to
enjoy life should be, independent of the weather.</p>
<p>Later on, as if disheartened by our indifference, the rain ceased,
and we took our chairs out on the deck, and sat watching the lightning,
which still played incessantly.&nbsp; Then, not unnaturally, the talk
drifted into a sombre channel, and we began recounting stories, dealing
with the gloomy and mysterious side of life.</p>
<p>Some of these were worth remembering, and some were not.&nbsp; The
one that left the strongest impression on my mind was a tale that Jephson
told us.</p>
<p>I had been relating a somewhat curious experience of my own.&nbsp;
I met a man in the Strand one day that I knew very well, as I thought,
though I had not seen him for years.&nbsp; We walked together to Charing
Cross, and there we shook hands and parted.&nbsp; Next morning, I spoke
of this meeting to a mutual friend, and then I learnt, for the first
time, that the man had died six months before.</p>
<p>The natural inference was that I had mistaken one man for another,
an error that, not having a good memory for faces, I frequently fall
into.&nbsp; What was remarkable about the matter, however, was that
throughout our walk I had conversed with the man under the impression
that he was that other dead man, and, whether by coincidence or not,
his replies had never once suggested to me my mistake.</p>
<p>As soon as I finished, Jephson, who had been listening very thoughtfully,
asked me if I believed in spiritualism &ldquo;to its fullest extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is rather a large question,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;spiritualism to its fullest extent&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you believe that the spirits of the dead have not
only the power of revisiting this earth at their will, but that, when
here, they have the power of action, or rather, of exciting to action?&nbsp;
Let me put a definite case.&nbsp; A spiritualist friend of mine, a sensible
and by no means imaginative man, once told me that a table, through
the medium of which the spirit of a friend had been in the habit of
communicating with him, came slowly across the room towards him, of
its own accord, one night as he sat alone, and pinioned him against
the wall.&nbsp; Now can any of you believe that, or can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could,&rdquo; Brown took it upon himself to reply; &ldquo;but,
before doing so, I should wish for an introduction to the friend who
told you the story.&nbsp; Speaking generally,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it
seems to me that the difference between what we call the natural and
the supernatural is merely the difference between frequency and rarity
of occurrence.&nbsp; Having regard to the phenomena we are compelled
to admit, I think it illogical to disbelieve anything we are unable
to disprove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; remarked MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;I can
believe in the ability of our spirit friends to give the quaint entertainments
credited to them much easier than I can in their desire to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; added Jephson, &ldquo;that you cannot understand
why a spirit, not compelled as we are by the exigencies of society,
should care to spend its evenings carrying on a laboured and childish
conversation with a room full of abnormally uninteresting people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is precisely what I cannot understand,&rdquo; MacShaughnassy
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, either,&rdquo; said Jephson.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I was
thinking of something very different altogether.&nbsp; Suppose a man
died with the dearest wish of his heart unfulfilled, do you believe
that his spirit might have power to return to earth and complete the
interrupted work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;if one admits
the possibility of spirits retaining any interest in the affairs of
this world at all, it is certainly more reasonable to imagine them engaged
upon a task such as you suggest, than to believe that they occupy themselves
with the performance of mere drawing-room tricks.&nbsp; But what are
you leading up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to this,&rdquo; replied Jephson, seating himself straddle-legged
across his chair, and leaning his arms upon the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was told a story this morning at the hospital by an old French doctor.&nbsp;
The actual facts are few and simple; all that is known can be read in
the Paris police records of sixty-two years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most important part of the case, however, is the part
that is not known, and that never will be known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story begins with a great wrong done by one man unto another
man.&nbsp; What the wrong was I do not know.&nbsp; I am inclined to
think, however, it was connected with a woman.&nbsp; I think that, because
he who had been wronged hated him who had wronged him with a hate such
as does not often burn in a man&rsquo;s brain, unless it be fanned by
the memory of a woman&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still that is only conjecture, and the point is immaterial.&nbsp;
The man who had done the wrong fled, and the other man followed him.&nbsp;
It became a point-to-point race, the first man having the advantage
of a day&rsquo;s start.&nbsp; The course was the whole world, and the
stakes were the first man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travellers were few and far between in those days, and this
made the trail easy to follow.&nbsp; The first man, never knowing how
far or how near the other was behind him, and hoping now and again that
he might have baffled him, would rest for a while.&nbsp; The second
man, knowing always just how far the first one was before him, never
paused, and thus each day the man who was spurred by Hate drew nearer
to the man who was spurred by Fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this town the answer to the never-varied question would
be:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At seven o&rsquo;clock last evening, M&rsquo;sieur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven&mdash;ah; eighteen hours.&nbsp; Give me something
to eat, quick, while the horses are being put to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the next the calculation would be sixteen hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing a lonely ch&acirc;let, Monsieur puts his head out
of the window:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How long since a carriage passed this way, with a tall,
fair man inside?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Such a one passed early this morning, M&rsquo;sieur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks, drive on, a hundred francs apiece if you are
through the pass before daybreak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what for dead horses, M&rsquo;sieur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twice their value when living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day the man who was ridden by Fear looked up, and saw
before him the open door of a cathedral, and, passing in, knelt down
and prayed.&nbsp; He prayed long and fervently, for men, when they are
in sore straits, clutch eagerly at the straws of faith.&nbsp; He prayed
that he might be forgiven his sin, and, more important still, that he
might be pardoned the consequences of his sin, and be delivered from
his adversary; and a few chairs from him, facing him, knelt his enemy,
praying also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the second man&rsquo;s prayer, being a thanksgiving merely,
was short, so that when the first man raised his eyes, he saw the face
of his enemy gazing at him across the chair-tops, with a mocking smile
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made no attempt to rise, but remained kneeling, fascinated
by the look of joy that shone out of the other man&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
And the other man moved the high-backed chairs one by one, and came
towards him softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, just as the man who had been wronged stood beside the
man who had wronged him, full of gladness that his opportunity had come,
there burst from the cathedral tower a sudden clash of bells, and the
man, whose opportunity had come, broke his heart and fell back dead,
with that mocking smile still playing round his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he lay there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the man who had done the wrong rose up and passed out,
praising God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the body of the other man is not known.&nbsp;
It was the body of a stranger who had died suddenly in the cathedral.&nbsp;
There was none to identify it, none to claim it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years passed away, and the survivor in the tragedy became
a worthy and useful citizen, and a noted man of science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his laboratory were many objects necessary to him in his
researches, and, prominent among them, stood in a certain corner a human
skeleton.&nbsp; It was a very old and much-mended skeleton, and one
day the long-expected end arrived, and it tumbled to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it became necessary to purchase another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of science visited a dealer he well knew&mdash;a little
parchment-faced old man who kept a dingy shop, where nothing was ever
sold, within the shadow of the towers of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little parchment-faced old man had just the very thing
that Monsieur wanted&mdash;a singularly fine and well-proportioned &lsquo;study.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It should be sent round and set up in Monsieur&rsquo;s laboratory that
very afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dealer was as good as his word.&nbsp; When Monsieur entered
his laboratory that evening, the thing was in its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur seated himself in his high-backed chair, and tried
to collect his thoughts.&nbsp; But Monsieur&rsquo;s thoughts were unruly,
and inclined to wander, and to wander always in one direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur opened a large volume and commenced to read.&nbsp;
He read of a man who had wronged another and fled from him, the other
man following.&nbsp; Finding himself reading this, he closed the book
angrily, and went and stood by the window and looked out.&nbsp; He saw
before him the sun-pierced nave of a great cathedral, and on the stones
lay a dead man with a mocking smile upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursing himself for a fool, he turned away with a laugh.&nbsp;
But his laugh was short-lived, for it seemed to him that something else
in the room was laughing also.&nbsp; Struck suddenly still, with his
feet glued to the ground, he stood listening for a while: then sought
with starting eyes the corner from where the sound had seemed to come.&nbsp;
But the white thing standing there was only grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur wiped the damp sweat from his head and hands, and
stole out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a couple of days he did not enter the room again.&nbsp;
On the third, telling himself that his fears were those of a hysterical
girl, he opened the door and went in.&nbsp; To shame himself, he took
his lamp in his hand, and crossing over to the far corner where the
skeleton stood, examined it.&nbsp; A set of bones bought for three hundred
francs.&nbsp; Was he a child, to be scared by such a bogey!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held his lamp up in front of the thing&rsquo;s grinning
head.&nbsp; The flame of the lamp flickered as though a faint breath
had passed over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man explained this to himself by saying that the walls
of the house were old and cracked, and that the wind might creep in
anywhere.&nbsp; He repeated this explanation to himself as he recrossed
the room, walking backwards, with his eyes fixed on the thing.&nbsp;
When he reached his desk, he sat down and gripped the arms of his chair
till his fingers turned white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried to work, but the empty sockets in that grinning head
seemed to be drawing him towards them.&nbsp; He rose and battled with
his inclination to fly screaming from the room.&nbsp; Glancing fearfully
about him, his eye fell upon a high screen, standing before the door.&nbsp;
He dragged it forward, and placed it between himself and the thing,
so that he could not see it&mdash;nor it see him.&nbsp; Then he sat
down again to his work.&nbsp; For a while he forced himself to look
at the book in front of him, but at last, unable to control himself
any longer, he suffered his eyes to follow their own bent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been an hallucination.&nbsp; He may have accidentally
placed the screen so as to favour such an illusion.&nbsp; But what he
saw was a bony hand coming round the corner of the screen, and, with
a cry, he fell to the floor in a swoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people of the house came running in, and lifting him up,
carried him out, and laid him upon his bed.&nbsp; As soon as he recovered,
his first question was, where had they found the thing&mdash;where was
it when they entered the room? and when they told him they had seen
it standing where it always stood, and had gone down into the room to
look again, because of his frenzied entreaties, and returned trying
to hide their smiles, he listened to their talk about overwork, and
the necessity for change and rest, and said they might do with him as
they would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So for many months the laboratory door remained locked.&nbsp;
Then there came a chill autumn evening when the man of science opened
it again, and closed it behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lighted his lamp, and gathered his instruments and books
around him, and sat down before them in his high-backed chair.&nbsp;
And the old terror returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this time he meant to conquer himself.&nbsp; His nerves
were stronger now, and his brain clearer; he would fight his unreasoning
fear.&nbsp; He crossed to the door and locked himself in, and flung
the key to the other end of the room, where it fell among jars and bottles
with an echoing clatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on, his old housekeeper, going her final round, tapped
at his door and wished him good-night, as was her custom.&nbsp; She
received no response, at first, and, growing nervous, tapped louder
and called again; and at length an answering &lsquo;good-night&rsquo;
came back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thought little about it at the time, but afterwards she
remembered that the voice that had replied to her had been strangely
grating and mechanical.&nbsp; Trying to describe it, she likened it
to such a voice as she would imagine coming from a statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning his door remained still locked.&nbsp; It was
no unusual thing for him to work all night and far into the next day,
so no one thought to be surprised.&nbsp; When, however, evening came,
and yet he did not appear, his servants gathered outside the room and
whispered, remembering what had happened once before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They listened, but could hear no sound.&nbsp; They shook the
door and called to him, then beat with their fists upon the wooden panels.&nbsp;
But still no sound came from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becoming alarmed, they decided to burst open the door, and,
after many blows, it gave way, and they crowded in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sat bolt upright in his high-backed chair.&nbsp; They thought
at first he had died in his sleep.&nbsp; But when they drew nearer and
the light fell upon him, they saw the livid marks of bony fingers round
his throat; and in his eyes there was a terror such as is not often
seen in human eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Brown was the first to break the silence that followed.&nbsp; He
asked me if I had any brandy on board.&nbsp; He said he felt he should
like just a nip of brandy before going to bed.&nbsp; That is one of
the chief charms of Jephson&rsquo;s stories: they always make you feel
you want a little brandy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Cats,&rdquo; remarked Jephson to me, one afternoon, as we
sat in the punt discussing the plot of our novel, &ldquo;cats are animals
for whom I entertain a very great respect.&nbsp; Cats and Nonconformists
seem to me the only things in this world possessed of a practicable
working conscience.&nbsp; Watch a cat doing something mean and wrong&mdash;if
ever one gives you the chance; notice how anxious she is that nobody
should see her doing it; and how prompt, if detected, to pretend that
she was not doing it&mdash;that she was not even thinking of doing it&mdash;that,
as a matter of fact, she was just about to do something else, quite
different.&nbsp; You might almost think they had a soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this morning I was watching that tortoise-shell of yours
on the houseboat.&nbsp; She was creeping along the roof, behind the
flower-boxes, stalking a young thrush that had perched upon a coil of
rope.&nbsp; Murder gleamed from her eye, assassination lurked in every
twitching muscle of her body.&nbsp; As she crouched to spring, Fate,
for once favouring the weak, directed her attention to myself, and she
became, for the first time, aware of my presence.&nbsp; It acted upon
her as a heavenly vision upon a Biblical criminal.&nbsp; In an instant
she was a changed being.&nbsp; The wicked beast, going about seeking
whom it might devour, had vanished.&nbsp; In its place sat a long-tailed,
furry angel, gazing up into the sky with an expression that was one-third
innocence and two-thirds admiration of the beauties of nature.&nbsp;
What was she doing there, did I want to know?&nbsp; Why, could I not
see, playing with a bit of earth.&nbsp; Surely I was not so evil-minded
as to imagine she wanted to kill that dear little bird&mdash;God bless
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then note an old Tom, slinking home in the early morning,
after a night spent on a roof of bad repute.&nbsp; Can you picture to
yourself a living creature less eager to attract attention?&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
me,&rsquo; you can all but hear it saying to itself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d
no idea it was so late; how time does go when one is enjoying oneself.&nbsp;
I do hope I shan&rsquo;t meet any one I know&mdash;very awkward, it&rsquo;s
being so light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the distance it sees a policeman, and stops suddenly within
the shelter of a shadow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now what&rsquo;s he doing there,&rsquo;
it says, &lsquo;and close to our door too?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t go in
while he&rsquo;s hanging about.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s sure to see and recognise
me; and he&rsquo;s just the sort of man to talk to the servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hides itself behind a post and waits, peeping cautiously
round the corner from time to time.&nbsp; The policeman, however, seems
to have taken up his residence at that particular spot, and the cat
becomes worried and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the fool?&rsquo; it mutters
indignantly; &lsquo;is he dead?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t he move on, he&rsquo;s
always telling other people to.&nbsp; Stupid ass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then a far-off cry of &lsquo;milk&rsquo; is heard, and
the cat starts up in an agony of alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Great Scott, hark
at that!&nbsp; Why, everybody will be down before I get in.&nbsp; Well,
I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; I must chance it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He glances round at himself, and hesitates.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind if I didn&rsquo;t look so dirty and untidy,&rsquo;
he muses; &lsquo;people are so prone to think evil in this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; he adds, giving himself a shake, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing else for it, I must put my trust in Providence, it&rsquo;s pulled
me through before: here goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He assumes an aspect of chastened sorrow, and trots along
with a demure and saddened step.&nbsp; It is evident he wishes to convey
the idea that he has been out all night on work connected with the Vigilance
Association, and is now returning home sick at heart because of the
sights that he has seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He squirms in, unnoticed, through a window, and has just time
to give himself a hurried lick down before he hears the cook&rsquo;s
step on the stairs.&nbsp; When she enters the kitchen he is curled up
on the hearthrug, fast asleep.&nbsp; The opening of the shutters awakes
him.&nbsp; He rises and comes forward, yawning and stretching himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear me, is it morning, then?&rsquo; he says drowsily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Heigh-ho!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had such a lovely sleep, cook; and
such a beautiful dream about poor mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cats! do you call them?&nbsp; Why, they are Christians in
everything except the number of legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly are,&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;wonderfully
cunning little animals, and it is not by their moral and religious instincts
alone that they are so closely linked to man; the marvellous ability
they display in taking care of &lsquo;number one&rsquo; is worthy of
the human race itself.&nbsp; Some friends of mine had a cat, a big black
Tom: they have got half of him still.&nbsp; They had reared him from
a kitten, and, in their homely, undemonstrative way, they liked him.&nbsp;
There was nothing, however, approaching passion on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a Chinchilla came to live in the neighbourhood, under
the charge of an elderly spinster, and the two cats met at a garden
wall party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What sort of diggings have you got?&rsquo; asked the
Chinchilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, pretty fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nice people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, nice enough&mdash;as people go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pretty willing?&nbsp; Look after you well, and all
that sort of thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;oh yes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no fault to find
with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the victuals like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, the usual thing, you know, bones and scraps, and
a bit of dog-biscuit now and then for a change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bones and dog-biscuits!&nbsp; Do you mean to say you
eat bones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, when I can get &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s
wrong about them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shade of Egyptian Isis, bones and dog-biscuits!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you ever get any spring chickens, or a sardine, or a lamb
cutlet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chickens!&nbsp; Sardines!&nbsp; What are you talking
about?&nbsp; What are sardines?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are sardines!&nbsp; Oh, my dear child (the Chinchilla
was a lady cat, and always called gentlemen friends a little older than
herself &lsquo;dear child&rsquo;), these people of yours are treating
you just shamefully.&nbsp; Come, sit down and tell me all about it.&nbsp;
What do they give you to sleep on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The floor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought so; and skim milk and water to drink, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It <i>is</i> a bit thin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can quite imagine it.&nbsp; You must leave these
people, my dear, at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But where am I to go to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But who&rsquo;ll take me in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anybody, if you go the right way to work.&nbsp; How
many times do you think I&rsquo;ve changed my people?&nbsp; Seven!&mdash;and
bettered myself on each occasion.&nbsp; Why, do you know where I was
born?&nbsp; In a pig-sty.&nbsp; There were three of us, mother and I
and my little brother.&nbsp; Mother would leave us every evening, returning
generally just as it was getting light.&nbsp; One morning she did not
come back.&nbsp; We waited and waited, but the day passed on and she
did not return, and we grew hungrier and hungrier, and at last we lay
down, side by side, and cried ourselves to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the evening, peeping through a hole in the door,
we saw her coming across the field.&nbsp; She was crawling very slowly,
with her body close down against the ground.&nbsp; We called to her,
and she answered with a low &ldquo;crroo&rdquo;; but she did not hasten
her pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She crept in and rolled over on her side, and we ran
to her, for we were almost starving.&nbsp; We lay long upon her breasts,
and she licked us over and over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I dropped asleep upon her, and in the night I awoke,
feeling cold.&nbsp; I crept closer to her, but that only made me colder
still, and she was wet and clammy with a dark moisture that was oozing
from her side.&nbsp; I did not know what it was at that time, but I
have learnt since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was when I could hardly have been four weeks old,
and from that day to this I&rsquo;ve looked after myself: you&rsquo;ve
got to do that in this world, my dear.&nbsp; For a while, I and my brother
lived on in that sty and kept ourselves.&nbsp; It was a grim struggle
at first, two babies fighting for life; but we pulled through.&nbsp;
At the end of about three months, wandering farther from home than usual,
I came upon a cottage, standing in the fields.&nbsp; It looked warm
and cosy through the open door, and I went in: I have always been blessed
with plenty of nerve.&nbsp; Some children were playing round the fire,
and they welcomed me and made much of me.&nbsp; It was a new sensation
to me, and I stayed there.&nbsp; I thought the place a palace at the
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I might have gone on thinking so if it had not been
that, passing through the village one day, I happened to catch sight
of a room behind a shop.&nbsp; There was a carpet on the floor, and
a rug before the fire.&nbsp; I had never known till then that there
were such luxuries in the world.&nbsp; I determined to make that shop
my home, and I did so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How did you manage it?&rsquo; asked the black cat,
who was growing interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By the simple process of walking in and sitting down.&nbsp;
My dear child, cheek&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Open sesame&rdquo; to every
door.&nbsp; The cat that works hard dies of starvation, the cat that
has brains is kicked downstairs for a fool, and the cat that has virtue
is drowned for a scamp; but the cat that has cheek sleeps on a velvet
cushion and dines on cream and horseflesh.&nbsp; I marched straight
in and rubbed myself against the old man&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp; He and
his wife were quite taken with what they called my &ldquo;trustfulness,&rdquo;
and adopted me with enthusiasm.&nbsp; Strolling about the fields of
an evening I often used to hear the children of the cottage calling
my name.&nbsp; It was weeks before they gave up seeking for me.&nbsp;
One of them, the youngest, would sob herself to sleep of a night, thinking
that I was dead: they were affectionate children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I boarded with my shopkeeping friends for nearly a
year, and from them I went to some new people who had lately come to
the neighbourhood, and who possessed a really excellent cook.&nbsp;
I think I could have been very satisfied with these people, but, unfortunately,
they came down in the world, and had to give up the big house and the
cook, and take a cottage, and I did not care to go back to that sort
of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Accordingly I looked about for a fresh opening.&nbsp;
There was a curious old fellow who lived not far off.&nbsp; People said
he was rich, but nobody liked him.&nbsp; He was shaped differently from
other men.&nbsp; I turned the matter over in my mind for a day or two,
and then determined to give him a trial.&nbsp; Being a lonely sort of
man, he might make a fuss over me, and if not I could go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My surmise proved correct.&nbsp; I have never been
more petted than I was by &ldquo;Toady,&rdquo; as the village boys had
dubbed him.&nbsp; My present guardian is foolish enough over me, goodness
knows, but she has other ties, while &ldquo;Toady&rdquo; had nothing
else to love, not even himself.&nbsp; He could hardly believe his eyes
at first when I jumped up on his knees and rubbed myself against his
ugly face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Kitty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know
you&rsquo;re the first living thing that has ever come to me of its
own accord.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were tears in his funny little red eyes
as he said that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I remained two years with &ldquo;Toady,&rdquo; and
was very happy indeed.&nbsp; Then he fell ill, and strange people came
to the house, and I was neglected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Toady&rdquo; liked me
to come up and lie upon the bed, where he could stroke me with his long,
thin hand, and at first I used to do this.&nbsp; But a sick man is not
the best of company, as you can imagine, and the atmosphere of a sick
room not too healthy, so, all things considered, I felt it was time
for me to make a fresh move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had some difficulty in getting away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Toady&rdquo;
was always asking for me, and they tried to keep me with him: he seemed
to lie easier when I was there.&nbsp; I succeeded at length, however,
and, once outside the door, I put sufficient distance between myself
and the house to ensure my not being captured, for I knew &ldquo;Toady&rdquo;
so long as he lived would never cease hoping to get me back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where to go, I did not know.&nbsp; Two or three homes
were offered me, but none of them quite suited me.&nbsp; At one place,
where I put up for a day, just to see how I liked it, there was a dog;
and at another, which would otherwise have done admirably, they kept
a baby.&nbsp; Whatever you do, never stop at a house where they keep
a baby.&nbsp; If a child pulls your tail or ties a paper bag round your
head, you can give it one for itself and nobody blames you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
serve you right,&rdquo; they say to the yelling brat, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t
tease the poor thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if you resent a baby&rsquo;s
holding you by the throat and trying to gouge out your eye with a wooden
ladle, you are called a spiteful beast, and &ldquo;shoo&rsquo;d&rdquo;
all round the garden.&nbsp; If people keep babies, they don&rsquo;t
keep me; that&rsquo;s my rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After sampling some three or four families, I finally
fixed upon a banker.&nbsp; Offers more advantageous from a worldly point
of view were open to me.&nbsp; I could have gone to a public-house,
where the victuals were simply unlimited, and where the back door was
left open all night.&nbsp; But about the banker&rsquo;s (he was also
a churchwarden, and his wife never smiled at anything less than a joke
by the bishop) there was an atmosphere of solid respectability that
I felt would be comforting to my nature.&nbsp; My dear child, you will
come across cynics who will sneer at respectability: don&rsquo;t you
listen to them.&nbsp; Respectability is its own reward&mdash;and a very
real and practical reward.&nbsp; It may not bring you dainty dishes
and soft beds, but it brings you something better and more lasting.&nbsp;
It brings you the consciousness that you are living the right life,
that you are doing the right thing, that, so far as earthly ingenuity
can fix it, you are going to the right place, and that other folks ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you ever let any one set you against respectability.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the most satisfying thing I know of in this world&mdash;and
about the cheapest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was nearly three years with this family, and was
sorry when I had to go.&nbsp; I should never have left if I could have
helped it, but one day something happened at the bank which necessitated
the banker&rsquo;s taking a sudden journey to Spain, and, after that,
the house became a somewhat unpleasant place to live in.&nbsp; Noisy,
disagreeable people were continually knocking at the door and making
rows in the passage; and at night folks threw bricks at the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was in a delicate state of health at the time, and
my nerves could not stand it.&nbsp; I said good-bye to the town, and
making my way back into the country, put up with a county family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They were great swells, but I should have preferred
them had they been more homely.&nbsp; I am of an affectionate disposition,
and I like every one about me to love me.&nbsp; They were good enough
to me in their distant way, but they did not take much notice of me,
and I soon got tired of lavishing attentions on people that neither
valued nor responded to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From these people I went to a retired potato merchant.&nbsp;
It was a social descent, but a rise so far as comfort and appreciation
were concerned.&nbsp; They appeared to be an exceedingly nice family,
and to be extremely fond of me.&nbsp; I say they &ldquo;appeared&rdquo;
to be these things, because the sequel proved that they were neither.&nbsp;
Six months after I had come to them they went away and left me.&nbsp;
They never asked me to accompany them.&nbsp; They made no arrangements
for me to stay behind.&nbsp; They evidently did not care what became
of me.&nbsp; Such egotistical indifference to the claims of friendship
I had never before met with.&nbsp; It shook my faith&mdash;never too
robust&mdash;in human nature.&nbsp; I determined that, in future, no
one should have the opportunity of disappointing my trust in them.&nbsp;
I selected my present mistress on the recommendation of a gentleman
friend of mine who had formerly lived with her.&nbsp; He said she was
an excellent caterer.&nbsp; The only reason he had left her was that
she expected him to be in at ten each night, and that hour didn&rsquo;t
fit in with his other arrangements.&nbsp; It made no difference to me&mdash;as
a matter of fact, I do not care for these midnight <i>r&eacute;unions</i>
that are so popular amongst us.&nbsp; There are always too many cats
for one properly to enjoy oneself, and sooner or later a rowdy element
is sure to creep in.&nbsp; I offered myself to her, and she accepted
me gratefully.&nbsp; But I have never liked her, and never shall.&nbsp;
She is a silly old woman, and bores me.&nbsp; She is, however, devoted
to me, and, unless something extra attractive turns up, I shall stick
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That, my dear, is the story of my life, so far as it
has gone.&nbsp; I tell it you to show you how easy it is to be &ldquo;taken
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fix on your house, and mew piteously at the back door.&nbsp;
When it is opened run in and rub yourself against the first leg you
come across.&nbsp; Rub hard, and look up confidingly.&nbsp; Nothing
gets round human beings, I have noticed, quicker than confidence.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t get much of it, and it pleases them.&nbsp; Always be
confiding.&nbsp; At the same time be prepared for emergencies.&nbsp;
If you are still doubtful as to your reception, try and get yourself
slightly wet.&nbsp; Why people should prefer a wet cat to a dry one
I have never been able to understand; but that a wet cat is practically
sure of being taken in and gushed over, while a dry cat is liable to
have the garden hose turned upon it, is an undoubted fact.&nbsp; Also,
if you can possibly manage it, and it is offered you, eat a bit of dry
bread.&nbsp; The Human Race is always stirred to its deepest depths
by the sight of a cat eating a bit of dry bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend&rsquo;s black Tom profited by the Chinchilla&rsquo;s
wisdom.&nbsp; A catless couple had lately come to live next door.&nbsp;
He determined to adopt them on trial.&nbsp; Accordingly, on the first
rainy day, he went out soon after lunch and sat for four hours in an
open field.&nbsp; In the evening, soaked to the skin, and feeling pretty
hungry, he went mewing to their door.&nbsp; One of the maids opened
it, he rushed under her skirts and rubbed himself against her legs.&nbsp;
She screamed, and down came the master and the mistress to know what
was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a stray cat, mum,&rsquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Turn it out,&rsquo; said the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, poor thing, it&rsquo;s wet,&rsquo; said the housemaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s hungry,&rsquo; said the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Try it with a bit of dry bread,&rsquo; sneered the
master, who wrote for the newspapers, and thought he knew everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stale crust was proffered.&nbsp; The cat ate it greedily,
and afterwards rubbed himself gratefully against the man&rsquo;s light
trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This made the man ashamed of himself, likewise of his trousers.
&lsquo;Oh, well, let it stop if it wants to,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the cat was made comfortable, and stayed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile its own family were seeking for it high and low.&nbsp;
They had not cared over much for it while they had had it; now it was
gone, they were inconsolable.&nbsp; In the light of its absence, it
appeared to them the one thing that had made the place home.&nbsp; The
shadows of suspicion gathered round the case.&nbsp; The cat&rsquo;s
disappearance, at first regarded as a mystery, began to assume the shape
of a crime.&nbsp; The wife openly accused the husband of never having
liked the animal, and more than hinted that he and the gardener between
them could give a tolerably truthful account of its last moments; an
insinuation that the husband repudiated with a warmth that only added
credence to the original surmise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bull-terrier was had up and searchingly examined.&nbsp;
Fortunately for him, he had not had a single fight for two whole days.&nbsp;
Had any recent traces of blood been detected upon him, it would have
gone hard with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person who suffered most, however, was the youngest boy.&nbsp;
Three weeks before, he had dressed the cat in doll&rsquo;s clothes and
taken it round the garden in the perambulator.&nbsp; He himself had
forgotten the incident, but Justice, though tardy, was on his track.&nbsp;
The misdeed was suddenly remembered at the very moment when unavailing
regret for the loss of the favourite was at its deepest, so that to
box his ears and send him, then and there, straight off to bed was felt
to be a positive relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of a fortnight, the cat, finding he had not, after
all, bettered himself, came back.&nbsp; The family were so surprised
that at first they could not be sure whether he was flesh and blood,
or a spirit come to comfort them.&nbsp; After watching him eat half
a pound of raw steak, they decided he was material, and caught him up
and hugged him to their bosoms.&nbsp; For a week they over-fed him and
made much of him.&nbsp; Then, the excitement cooling, he found himself
dropping back into his old position, and didn&rsquo;t like it, and went
next door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next door people had also missed him, and they likewise
greeted his return with extravagant ebullitions of joy.&nbsp; This gave
the cat an idea.&nbsp; He saw that his game was to play the two families
off one against the other; which he did.&nbsp; He spent an alternate
fortnight with each, and lived like a fighting cock.&nbsp; His return
was always greeted with enthusiasm, and every means were adopted to
induce him to stay.&nbsp; His little whims were carefully studied, his
favourite dishes kept in constant readiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The destination of his goings leaked out at length, and then
the two families quarrelled about him over the fence.&nbsp; My friend
accused the newspaper man of having lured him away.&nbsp; The newspaper
man retorted that the poor creature had come to his door wet and starving,
and added that he would be ashamed to keep an animal merely to ill-treat
it.&nbsp; They have a quarrel about him twice a week on the average.&nbsp;
It will probably come to blows one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jephson appeared much surprised by this story.&nbsp; He remained
thoughtful and silent.&nbsp; I asked him if he would like to hear any
more, and as he offered no active opposition I went on.&nbsp; (Maybe
he was asleep; that idea did not occur to me at the time.)</p>
<p>I told him of my grandmother&rsquo;s cat, who, after living a blameless
life for upwards of eleven years, and bringing up a family of something
like sixty-six, not counting those that died in infancy and the water-butt,
took to drink in her old age, and was run over while in a state of intoxication
(oh, the justice of it! ) by a brewer&rsquo;s dray.&nbsp; I have read
in temperance tracts that no dumb animal will touch a drop of alcoholic
liquor.&nbsp; My advice is, if you wish to keep them respectable, don&rsquo;t
give them a chance to get at it.&nbsp; I knew a pony&mdash;But never
mind him; we are talking about my grandmother&rsquo;s cat.</p>
<p>A leaky beer-tap was the cause of her downfall.&nbsp; A saucer used
to be placed underneath it to catch the drippings.&nbsp; One day the
cat, coming in thirsty, and finding nothing else to drink, lapped up
a little, liked it, and lapped a little more, went away for half an
hour, and came back and finished the saucerful.&nbsp; Then sat down
beside it, and waited for it to fill again.</p>
<p>From that day till the hour she died, I don&rsquo;t believe that
cat was ever once quite sober.&nbsp; Her days she passed in a drunken
stupor before the kitchen fire.&nbsp; Her nights she spent in the beer
cellar.</p>
<p>My grandmother, shocked and grieved beyond expression, gave up her
barrel and adopted bottles.&nbsp; The cat, thus condemned to enforced
abstinence, meandered about the house for a day and a half in a disconsolate,
quarrelsome mood.&nbsp; Then she disappeared, returning at eleven o&rsquo;clock
as tight as a drum.</p>
<p>Where she went, and how she managed to procure the drink, we never
discovered; but the same programme was repeated every day.&nbsp; Some
time during the morning she would contrive to elude our vigilance and
escape; and late every evening she would come reeling home across the
fields in a condition that I will not sully my pen by attempting to
describe.</p>
<p>It was on Saturday night that she met the sad end to which I have
before alluded.&nbsp; She must have been very drunk, for the man told
us that, in consequence of the darkness, and the fact that his horses
were tired, he was proceeding at little more than a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>
<p>I think my grandmother was rather relieved than otherwise.&nbsp;
She had been very fond of the cat at one time, but its recent conduct
had alienated her affection.&nbsp; We children buried it in the garden
under the mulberry tree, but the old lady insisted that there should
be no tombstone, not even a mound raised.&nbsp; So it lies there, unhonoured,
in a drunkard&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>I also told him of another cat our family had once possessed.&nbsp;
She was the most motherly thing I have ever known.&nbsp; She was never
happy without a family.&nbsp; Indeed, I cannot remember her when she
hadn&rsquo;t a family in one stage or another.&nbsp; She was not very
particular what sort of a family it was.&nbsp; If she could not have
kittens, then she would content herself with puppies or rats.&nbsp;
Anything that she could wash and feed seemed to satisfy her.&nbsp; I
believe she would have brought up chickens if we had entrusted them
to her.</p>
<p>All her brains must have run to motherliness, for she hadn&rsquo;t
much sense.&nbsp; She could never tell the difference between her own
children and other people&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She thought everything young
was a kitten.&nbsp; We once mixed up a spaniel puppy that had lost its
own mother among her progeny.&nbsp; I shall never forget her astonishment
when it first barked.&nbsp; She boxed both its ears, and then sat looking
down at it with an expression of indignant sorrow that was really touching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a credit to your mother,&rdquo; she
seemed to be saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a nice comfort to any one&rsquo;s
old age, you are, making a row like that.&nbsp; And look at your ears
flopping all over your face.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where you pick
up such ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a good little dog.&nbsp; He did try to mew, and he did try
to wash his face with his paw, and to keep his tail still, but his success
was not commensurate with his will.&nbsp; I do not know which was the
sadder to reflect upon, his efforts to become a creditable kitten, or
his foster-mother&rsquo;s despair of ever making him one.</p>
<p>Later on we gave her a baby squirrel to rear.&nbsp; She was nursing
a family of her own at the time, but she adopted him with enthusiasm,
under the impression that he was another kitten, though she could not
quite make out how she had come to overlook him.&nbsp; He soon became
her prime favourite.&nbsp; She liked his colour, and took a mother&rsquo;s
pride in his tail.&nbsp; What troubled her was that it would cock up
over his head.&nbsp; She would hold it down with one paw, and lick it
by the half-hour together, trying to make it set properly.&nbsp; But
the moment she let it go up it would cock again.&nbsp; I have heard
her cry with vexation because of this.</p>
<p>One day a neighbouring cat came to see her, and the squirrel was
clearly the subject of their talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good colour,&rdquo; said the friend, looking
critically at the supposed kitten, who was sitting up on his haunches
combing his whiskers, and saying the only truthfully pleasant thing
about him that she could think of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lovely colour,&rdquo; exclaimed our cat proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like his legs much,&rdquo; remarked the friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded his mother thoughtfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
right there.&nbsp; His legs are his weak point.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
say I think much of his legs myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll fill out later on,&rdquo; suggested the
friend, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope so,&rdquo; replied the mother, regaining her momentarily
dashed cheerfulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, they&rsquo;ll come all right
in time.&nbsp; And then look at his tail.&nbsp; Now, honestly, did you
ever see a kitten with a finer tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a good tail,&rdquo; assented the other; &ldquo;but
why do you do it up over his head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered our cat.&nbsp; &ldquo;It goes
that way.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make it out.&nbsp; I suppose it will come
straight as he gets older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be awkward if it don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m sure it will,&rdquo; replied our cat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must lick it more.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a tail that wants a good
deal of licking, you can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for hours that afternoon, after the other cat had gone, she sat
trimming it; and, at the end, when she lifted her paw off it, and it
flew back again like a steel spring over the squirrel&rsquo;s head,
she sat and gazed at it with feelings that only those among my readers
who have been mothers themselves will be able to comprehend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done,&rdquo; she seemed to say&mdash;&ldquo;what
have I done that this trouble should come upon me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jephson roused himself on my completion of this anecdote and sat
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your friends appear to have been the possessors of
some very remarkable cats,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;our family has been singularly
fortunate in its cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singularly so,&rdquo; agreed Jephson; &ldquo;I have never
met but one man from whom I have heard more wonderful cat talk than,
at one time or another, I have from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, not, perhaps without a touch of jealousy
in my voice, &ldquo;and who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a seafaring man,&rdquo; replied Jephson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
met him on a Hampstead tram, and we discussed the subject of animal
sagacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;monkeys is cute.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve come across monkeys as could give points to one or two lubbers
I&rsquo;ve sailed under; and elephants is pretty spry, if you can believe
all that&rsquo;s told of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard some tall
tales about elephants.&nbsp; And, of course, dogs has their heads screwed
on all right: I don&rsquo;t say as they ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But what
I do say is: that for straightfor&rsquo;ard, level-headed reasoning,
give me cats.&nbsp; You see, sir, a dog, he thinks a powerful deal of
a man&mdash;never was such a cute thing as a man, in a dog&rsquo;s opinion;
and he takes good care that everybody knows it.&nbsp; Naturally enough,
we says a dog is the most intellectual animal there is.&nbsp; Now a
cat, she&rsquo;s got her own opinion about human beings.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t
say much, but you can tell enough to make you anxious not to hear the
whole of it.&nbsp; The consequence is, we says a cat&rsquo;s got no
intelligence.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where we let our prejudice steer our
judgment wrong.&nbsp; In a matter of plain common sense, there ain&rsquo;t
a cat living as couldn&rsquo;t take the lee side of a dog and fly round
him.&nbsp; Now, have you ever noticed a dog at the end of a chain, trying
to kill a cat as is sitting washing her face three-quarters of an inch
out of his reach?&nbsp; Of course you have.&nbsp; Well, who&rsquo;s
got the sense out of those two?&nbsp; The cat knows that it ain&rsquo;t
in the nature of steel chains to stretch.&nbsp; The dog, who ought,
you&rsquo;d think, to know a durned sight more about &rsquo;em than
she does, is sure they will if you only bark loud enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then again, have you ever been made mad by cats screeching
in the night, and jumped out of bed and opened the window and yelled
at them?&nbsp; Did they ever budge an inch for that, though you shrieked
loud enough to skeer the dead, and waved your arms about like a man
in a play?&nbsp; Not they.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve turned and looked at
you, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yell away, old man,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ve
said, &ldquo;we like to hear you: the more the merrier.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then what have you done?&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;ve snatched up a hair-brush,
or a boot, or a candlestick, and made as if you&rsquo;d throw it at
them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve seen your attitude, they&rsquo;ve seen the
thing in your hand, but they ain&rsquo;t moved a point.&nbsp; They knew
as you weren&rsquo;t going to chuck valuable property out of window
with the chance of getting it lost or spoiled.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got
sense themselves, and they give you credit for having some.&nbsp; If
you don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the reason, you try showing them
a lump of coal, or half a brick, next time&mdash;something as they know
you <i>will</i> throw.&nbsp; Before you&rsquo;re ready to heave it,
there won&rsquo;t be a cat within aim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then as to judgment and knowledge of the world, why
dogs are babies to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Have you ever tried telling a yarn
before a cat, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied that cats had often been present during anecdotal
recitals of mine, but that, hitherto, I had paid no particular attention
to their demeanour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, well, you take an opportunity of doing so one day,
sir,&rsquo; answered the old fellow; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s worth the experiment.&nbsp;
If you&rsquo;re telling a story before a cat, and she don&rsquo;t get
uneasy during any part of the narrative, you can reckon you&rsquo;ve
got hold of a thing as it will be safe for you to tell to the Lord Chief
Justice of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a messmate,&rsquo; he continued; &lsquo;William
Cooley is his name.&nbsp; We call him Truthful Billy.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
as good a seaman as ever trod quarter-deck; but when he gets spinning
yarns he ain&rsquo;t the sort of man as I could advise you to rely upon.&nbsp;
Well, Billy, he&rsquo;s got a dog, and I&rsquo;ve seen him sit and tell
yarns before that dog that would make a cat squirm out of its skin,
and that dog&rsquo;s taken &rsquo;em in and believed &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
One night, up at his old woman&rsquo;s, Bill told us a yarn by the side
of which salt junk two voyages old would pass for spring chicken.&nbsp;
I watched the dog, to see how he would take it.&nbsp; He listened to
it from beginning to end with cocked ears, and never so much as blinked.&nbsp;
Every now and then he would look round with an expression of astonishment
or delight that seemed to say: &ldquo;Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me, just think of it!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, if that don&rsquo;t beat everything!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
a chuckle-headed dog; you could have told him anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It irritated me that Bill should have such an animal
about him to encourage him, and when he had finished I said to him,
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell that yarn round at my quarters one evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just a fancy of mine,&rsquo; I says.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t tell him I was wanting my old cat to hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, all right,&rsquo; says Bill, &lsquo;you remind
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He loved yarning, Billy did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Next night but one he slings himself up in my cabin,
and I does so.&nbsp; Nothing loth, off he starts.&nbsp; There was about
half-a-dozen of us stretched round, and the cat was sitting before the
fire fussing itself up.&nbsp; Before Bill had got fairly under weigh,
she stops washing and looks up at me, puzzled like, as much as to say,
&ldquo;What have we got here, a missionary?&rdquo;&nbsp; I signalled
to her to keep quiet, and Bill went on with his yarn.&nbsp; When he
got to the part about the sharks, she turned deliberately round and
looked at him.&nbsp; I tell you there was an expression of disgust on
that cat&rsquo;s face as might have made a travelling Cheap Jack feel
ashamed of himself.&nbsp; It was that human, I give you my word, sir,
I forgot for the moment as the poor animal couldn&rsquo;t speak.&nbsp;
I could see the words that were on its lips: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you tell us you swallowed the anchor?&rdquo; and I sat on tenter-hooks,
fearing each instant that she would say them aloud.&nbsp; It was a relief
to me when she turned her back on Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;For a few minutes she sat very still, and seemed to
be wrestling with herself like.&nbsp; I never saw a cat more set on
controlling its feelings, or that seemed to suffer more in silence.&nbsp;
It made my heart ache to watch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At last Bill came to the point where he and the captain
between &rsquo;em hold the shark&rsquo;s mouth open while the cabin-boy
dives in head foremost, and fetches up, undigested, the gold watch and
chain as the bo&rsquo;sun was a-wearing when he fell overboard; and
at that the old cat giv&rsquo;d a screech, and rolled over on her side
with her legs in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought at first the poor thing was dead, but she
rallied after a bit, and it seemed as though she had braced herself
up to hear the thing out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But a little further on, Bill got too much for her
again, and this time she owned herself beat.&nbsp; She rose up and looked
round at us: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said&mdash;leastways
that is what she said if looks go for anything&mdash;&ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;re
used to this sort of rubbish, and it don&rsquo;t get on your nerves.&nbsp;
With me it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ve heard as much
of this fool&rsquo;s talk as my constitution will stand, and if it&rsquo;s
all the same to you I&rsquo;ll get outside before I&rsquo;m sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With that she walked up to the door, and I opened it
for her, and she went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t fool a cat with talk same as you can
a dog.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Does man ever reform?&nbsp; Balzac says he doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; So
far as my experience goes, it agrees with that of Balzac&mdash;a fact
the admirers of that author are at liberty to make what use of they
please.</p>
<p>When I was young and accustomed to take my views of life from people
who were older than myself, and who knew better, so they said, I used
to believe that he did.&nbsp; Examples of &ldquo;reformed characters&rdquo;
were frequently pointed out to me&mdash;indeed, our village, situate
a few miles from a small seaport town, seemed to be peculiarly rich
in such.&nbsp; They were, from all accounts, including their own, persons
who had formerly behaved with quite unnecessary depravity, and who,
at the time I knew them, appeared to be going to equally objectionable
lengths in the opposite direction.&nbsp; They invariably belonged to
one of two classes, the low-spirited or the aggressively unpleasant.&nbsp;
They said, and I believed, that they were happy; but I could not help
reflecting how very sad they must have been before they were happy.</p>
<p>One of them, a small, meek-eyed old man with a piping voice, had
been exceptionally wild in his youth.&nbsp; What had been his special
villainy I could never discover.&nbsp; People responded to my inquiries
by saying that he had been &ldquo;Oh, generally bad,&rdquo; and increased
my longing for detail by adding that little boys ought not to want to
know about such things.&nbsp; From their tone and manner I assumed that
he must have been a pirate at the very least, and regarded him with
awe, not unmingled with secret admiration.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, he had been saved from it by his wife, a bony lady
of unprepossessing appearance, but irreproachable views.</p>
<p>One day he called at our house for some purpose or other, and, being
left alone with him for a few minutes, I took the opportunity of interviewing
him personally on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very wicked once, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I said,
seeking by emphasis on the &ldquo;once&rdquo; to mitigate what I felt
might be the disagreeable nature of the question.</p>
<p>To my intense surprise, a gleam of shameful glory lit up his wizened
face, and a sound which I tried to think a sigh, but which sounded like
a chuckle, escaped his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a bit of a spanker
in my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;spanker&rdquo; in such connection puzzled me.&nbsp;
I had been hitherto led to regard a spanker as an eminently conscientious
person, especially where the shortcomings of other people were concerned;
a person who laboured for the good of others.&nbsp; That the word could
also be employed to designate a sinful party was a revelation to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are good now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I continued,
dismissing further reflection upon the etymology of &ldquo;spanker&rdquo;
to a more fitting occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; he answered, his countenance resuming its customary
aspect of resigned melancholy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be a brand plucked from
the burning, I be.&nbsp; There beant much wrong wi&rsquo; Deacon Sawyers,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was your wife that made you good, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
I persisted, determined, now that I had started this investigation,
to obtain confirmation at first hand on all points.</p>
<p>At the mention of his wife his features became suddenly transformed.&nbsp;
Glancing hurriedly round, to make sure, apparently, that no one but
myself was within hearing, he leaned across and hissed these words into
my ear&mdash;I have never forgotten them, there was a ring of such evident
sincerity about them&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to skin her, I&rsquo;d like to skin her alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck me, even in the light of my then limited judgment, as an
unregenerate wish; and thus early my faith in the possibility of man&rsquo;s
reformation received the first of those many blows that have resulted
in shattering it.</p>
<p>Nature, whether human or otherwise, was not made to be reformed.&nbsp;
You can develop, you can check, but you cannot alter it.</p>
<p>You can take a small tiger and train it to sit on a hearthrug, and
to lap milk, and so long as you provide it with hearthrugs to lie on
and sufficient milk to drink, it will purr and behave like an affectionate
domestic pet.&nbsp; But it is a tiger, with all a tiger&rsquo;s instincts,
and its progeny to the end of all time will be tigers.</p>
<p>In the same way, you can take an ape and develop it through a few
thousand generations until it loses its tail and becomes an altogether
superior ape.&nbsp; You can go on developing it through still a few
more thousands of generations until it gathers to itself out of the
waste vapours of eternity an intellect and a soul, by the aid of which
it is enabled to keep the original apish nature more or less under control.</p>
<p>But the ape is still there, and always will be, and every now and
again, when Constable Civilisation turns his back for a moment, as during
&ldquo;Spanish Furies,&rdquo; or &ldquo;September massacres,&rdquo;
or Western mob rule, it creeps out and bites and tears at quivering
flesh, or plunges its hairy arms elbow deep in blood, or dances round
a burning nigger.</p>
<p>I knew a man once&mdash;or, rather, I knew of a man&mdash;who was
a confirmed drunkard.&nbsp; He became and continued a drunkard, not
through weakness, but through will.&nbsp; When his friends remonstrated
with him, he told them to mind their own business, and to let him mind
his.&nbsp; If he saw any reason for not getting drunk he would give
it up.&nbsp; Meanwhile he liked getting drunk, and he meant to get drunk
as often as possible.</p>
<p>He went about it deliberately, and did it thoroughly.&nbsp; For nearly
ten years, so it was reported, he never went to bed sober.&nbsp; This
may be an exaggeration&mdash;it would be a singular report were it not&mdash;but
it can be relied upon as sufficiently truthful for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>Then there came a day when he did see a reason for not getting drunk.&nbsp;
He signed no pledge, he took no oath.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I will never
touch another drop of drink,&rdquo; and for twenty-six years he kept
his word.</p>
<p>At the end of that time a combination of circumstances occurred that
made life troublesome to him, so that he desired to be rid of it altogether.&nbsp;
He was a man accustomed, when he desired a thing within his reach, to
stretch out his hand and take it.&nbsp; He reviewed the case calmly,
and decided to commit suicide.</p>
<p>If the thing were to be done at all, it would be best, for reasons
that if set forth would make this a long story, that it should be done
that very night, and, if possible, before eleven o&rsquo;clock, which
was the earliest hour a certain person could arrive from a certain place.</p>
<p>It was then four in the afternoon.&nbsp; He attended to some necessary
business, and wrote some necessary letters.&nbsp; This occupied him
until seven.&nbsp; He then called a cab and drove to a small hotel in
the suburbs, engaged a private room, and ordered up materials for the
making of the particular punch that had been the last beverage he had
got drunk on, six-and-twenty years ago.</p>
<p>For three hours he sat there drinking steadily, with his watch before
him.&nbsp; At half-past ten he rang the bell, paid his bill, came home,
and cut his throat.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a century people had been calling that man a &ldquo;reformed
character.&rdquo;&nbsp; His character had not reformed one jot.&nbsp;
The craving for drink had never died.&nbsp; For twenty-six years he
had, being a great man, held it gripped by the throat.&nbsp; When all
things became a matter of indifference to him, he loosened his grasp,
and the evil instinct rose up within him as strong on the day he died
as on the day he forced it down.</p>
<p>That is all a man can do, pray for strength to crush down the evil
that is in him, and to keep it held down day after day.&nbsp; I never
hear washy talk about &ldquo;changed characters&rdquo; and &ldquo;reformed
natures&rdquo; but I think of a sermon I once heard at a Wesleyan revivalist
meeting in the Black Country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! my friends, we&rsquo;ve all of us got the devil inside
us.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got him, you&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; cried the
preacher&mdash;he was an old man, with long white hair and beard, and
wild, fighting eyes.&nbsp; Most of the preachers who came &ldquo;reviving,&rdquo;
as it was called, through that district, had those eyes.&nbsp; Some
of them needed &ldquo;reviving&rdquo; themselves, in quite another sense,
before they got clear out of it.&nbsp; I am speaking now of more than
thirty years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! so us have&mdash;so us have,&rdquo; came the response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you carn&rsquo;t get rid of him,&rdquo; continued the
speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of oursel&rsquo;s,&rdquo; ejaculated a fervent voice at
the end of the room, &ldquo;but the Lord will help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old preacher turned on him almost fiercely:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But th&rsquo; Lord woan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;doan&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee reckon on that, lad.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve got him an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ve
got ta keep him.&nbsp; Ye carn&rsquo;t get rid of him.&nbsp; Th&rsquo;
Lord doan&rsquo;t mean &rsquo;ee to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here there broke forth murmurs of angry disapproval, but the old
fellow went on, unheeding:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It arn&rsquo;t good for &rsquo;ee to get rid of him.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ve just got to hug him tight.&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t let him go.&nbsp;
Hold him fast, and&mdash;LAM INTO HIM.&nbsp; I tell &rsquo;ee it&rsquo;s
good, healthy Christian exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had been discussing the subject with reference to our hero.&nbsp;
It had been suggested by Brown as an unhackneyed idea, and one lending
itself, therefore, to comparative freshness of treatment, that our hero
should be a thorough-paced scamp.</p>
<p>Jephson seconded the proposal, for the reason that it would the better
enable us to accomplish artistic work.&nbsp; He was of opinion that
we should be more sure of our ground in drawing a villain than in attempting
to portray a good man.</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy thirded (if I may coin what has often appeared to
me to be a much-needed word) the motion with ardour.&nbsp; He was tired,
he said, of the crystal-hearted, noble-thinking young man of fiction.&nbsp;
Besides, it made bad reading for the &ldquo;young person.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It gave her false ideas, and made her dissatisfied with mankind as he
really is.</p>
<p>And, thereupon, he launched forth and sketched us his idea of a hero,
with reference to whom I can only say that I should not like to meet
him on a dark night.</p>
<p>Brown, our one earnest member, begged us to be reasonable, and reminded
us, not for the first time, and not, perhaps, altogether unnecessarily,
that these meetings were for the purpose of discussing business, not
of talking nonsense.</p>
<p>Thus adjured, we attacked the subject conscientiously.</p>
<p>Brown&rsquo;s idea was that the man should be an out-and-out blackguard,
until about the middle of the book, when some event should transpire
that would have the effect of completely reforming him.&nbsp; This naturally
brought the discussion down to the question with which I have commenced
this chapter: Does man ever reform?&nbsp; I argued in the negative,
and gave the reasons for my disbelief much as I have set them forth
here.&nbsp; MacShaughnassy, on the other hand, contended that he did,
and instanced the case of himself&mdash;a man who, in his early days,
so he asserted, had been a scatterbrained, impracticable person, entirely
without stability.</p>
<p>I maintained that this was merely an example of enormous will-power
enabling a man to overcome and rise superior to the defects of character
with which nature had handicapped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion of you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is that you are naturally
a hopelessly irresponsible, well-meaning ass.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; I continued
quickly, seeing his hand reaching out towards a complete Shakespeare
in one volume that lay upon the piano, &ldquo;your mental capabilities
are of such extraordinary power that you can disguise this fact, and
make yourself appear a man of sense and wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown agreed with me that in MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s case traces of
the former disposition were clearly apparent, but pleaded that the illustration
was an unfortunate one, and that it ought not to have weight in the
discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously speaking,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
think that there are some experiences great enough to break up and re-form
a man&rsquo;s nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To break up,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;yes; but to re-form,
no.&nbsp; Passing through a great experience may shatter a man, or it
may strengthen a man, just as passing through a furnace may melt or
purify metal, but no furnace ever lit upon this earth can change a bar
of gold into a bar of lead, or a bar of lead into one of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked Jephson what he thought.&nbsp; He did not consider the bar
of gold simile a good one.&nbsp; He held that a man&rsquo;s character
was not an immutable element.&nbsp; He likened it to a drug&mdash;poison
or elixir&mdash;compounded by each man for himself from the pharmacopoeia
of all things known to life and time, and saw no impossibility, though
some improbability, in the glass being flung aside and a fresh draught
prepared with pain and labour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let us put the case practically;
did you ever know a man&rsquo;s character to change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I did know a man whose character
seemed to me to be completely changed by an experience that happened
to him.&nbsp; It may, as you say, only have been that he was shattered,
or that the lesson may have taught him to keep his natural disposition
ever under control.&nbsp; The result, in any case, was striking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We asked him to give us the history of the case, and he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a friend of some cousins of mine,&rdquo; Jephson began,
&ldquo;people I used to see a good deal of in my undergraduate days.&nbsp;
When I met him first he was a young fellow of twenty-six, strong mentally
and physically, and of a stern and stubborn nature that those who liked
him called masterful, and that those who disliked him&mdash;a more numerous
body&mdash;termed tyrannical.&nbsp; When I saw him three years later,
he was an old man of twenty-nine, gentle and yielding beyond the border-line
of weakness, mistrustful of himself and considerate of others to a degree
that was often unwise.&nbsp; Formerly, his anger had been a thing very
easily and frequently aroused.&nbsp; Since the change of which I speak,
I have never known the shade of anger to cross his face but once.&nbsp;
In the course of a walk, one day, we came upon a young rough terrifying
a small child by pretending to set a dog at her.&nbsp; He seized the
boy with a grip that almost choked him, and administered to him a punishment
that seemed to me altogether out of proportion to the crime, brutal
though it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remonstrated with him when he rejoined me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied apologetically; &lsquo;I suppose
I&rsquo;m a hard judge of some follies.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, knowing what
his haunted eyes were looking at, I said no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was junior partner in a large firm of tea brokers in the
City.&nbsp; There was not much for him to do in the London office, and
when, therefore, as the result of some mortgage transactions, a South
Indian tea plantation fell into the hands of the firm, it was suggested
that he should go out and take the management of it.&nbsp; The plan
suited him admirably.&nbsp; He was a man in every way qualified to lead
a rough life; to face a by no means contemptible amount of difficulty
and danger, to govern a small army of native workers more amenable to
fear than to affection.&nbsp; Such a life, demanding thought and action,
would afford his strong nature greater interest and enjoyment than he
could ever hope to obtain amid the cramped surroundings of civilisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing could in reason have been urged against the
arrangement, that thing was his wife.&nbsp; She was a fragile, delicate
girl, whom he had married in obedience to that instinct of attraction
towards the opposite which Nature, for the purpose of maintaining her
average, has implanted in our breasts&mdash;a timid, meek-eyed creature,
one of those women to whom death is less terrible than danger, and fate
easier to face than fear.&nbsp; Such women have been known to run screaming
from a mouse and to meet martyrdom with heroism.&nbsp; They can no more
keep their nerves from trembling than an aspen tree can stay the quivering
of its leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she was totally unfitted for, and would be made wretched
by the life to which his acceptance of the post would condemn her might
have readily occurred to him, had he stopped to consider for a moment
her feelings in the matter.&nbsp; But to view a question from any other
standpoint than his own was not his habit.&nbsp; That he loved her passionately,
in his way, as a thing belonging to himself, there can be no doubt,
but it was with the love that such men have for the dog they will thrash,
the horse they will spur to a broken back.&nbsp; To consult her on the
subject never entered his head.&nbsp; He informed her one day of his
decision and of the date of their sailing, and, handing her a handsome
cheque, told her to purchase all things necessary to her, and to let
him know if she needed more; and she, loving him with a dog-like devotion
that was not good for him, opened her big eyes a little wider, but said
nothing.&nbsp; She thought much about the coming change to herself,
however, and, when nobody was by, she would cry softly; then, hearing
his footsteps, would hastily wipe away the traces of her tears, and
go to meet him with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, her timidity and nervousness, which at home had been
a butt for mere chaff, became, under the new circumstances of their
life, a serious annoyance to the man.&nbsp; A woman who seemed unable
to repress a scream whenever she turned and saw in the gloom a pair
of piercing eyes looking out at her from a dusky face, who was liable
to drop off her horse with fear at the sound of a wild beast&rsquo;s
roar a mile off, and who would turn white and limp with horror at the
mere sight of a snake, was not a companionable person to live with in
the neighbourhood of Indian jungles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He himself was entirely without fear, and could not understand
it.&nbsp; To him it was pure affectation.&nbsp; He had a muddled idea,
common to men of his stamp, that women assume nervousness because they
think it pretty and becoming to them, and that if one could only convince
them of the folly of it they might be induced to lay it aside, in the
same way that they lay aside mincing steps and simpering voices.&nbsp;
A man who prided himself, as he did, upon his knowledge of horses, might,
one would think, have grasped a truer notion of the nature of nervousness,
which is a mere matter of temperament.&nbsp; But the man was a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that vexed him most was her horror of snakes.&nbsp;
He was unblessed&mdash;or uncursed, whichever you may prefer&mdash;with
imagination of any kind.&nbsp; There was no special enmity between him
and the seed of the serpent.&nbsp; A creature that crawled upon its
belly was no more terrible to him than a creature that walked upon its
legs; indeed, less so, for he knew that, as a rule, there was less danger
to be apprehended from them.&nbsp; A reptile is only too eager at all
times to escape from man.&nbsp; Unless attacked or frightened, it will
make no onset.&nbsp; Most people are content to acquire their knowledge
of this fact from the natural history books.&nbsp; He had proved it
for himself.&nbsp; His servant, an old sergeant of dragoons, has told
me that he has seen him stop with his face six inches from the head
of a hooded cobra, and stand watching it through his eye-glass as it
crawled away from him, knowing that one touch of its fangs would mean
death from which there could be no possible escape.&nbsp; That any reasoning
being should be inspired with terror&mdash;sickening, deadly terror&mdash;by
such pitifully harmless things, seemed to him monstrous; and he determined
to try and cure her of her fear of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He succeeded in doing this eventually somewhat more thoroughly
than he had anticipated, but it left a terror in his own eyes that has
not gone out of them to this day, and that never will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening, riding home through a part of the jungle not
far from his bungalow, he heard a soft, low hiss close to his ear, and,
looking up, saw a python swing itself from the branch of a tree and
make off through the long grass.&nbsp; He had been out antelope-shooting,
and his loaded rifle hung by his stirrup.&nbsp; Springing from the frightened
horse, he was just in time to get a shot at the creature before it disappeared.&nbsp;
He had hardly expected, under the circumstances, to even hit it.&nbsp;
By chance the bullet struck it at the junction of the vertebr&aelig;
with the head, and killed it instantly.&nbsp; It was a well-marked specimen,
and, except for the small wound the bullet had made, quite uninjured.&nbsp;
He picked it up, and hung it across the saddle, intending to take it
home and preserve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galloping along, glancing down every now and again at the
huge, hideous thing swaying and writhing in front of him almost as if
still alive, a brilliant idea occurred to him.&nbsp; He would use this
dead reptile to cure his wife of her fear of living ones.&nbsp; He would
fix matters so that she should see it, and think it was alive, and be
terrified by it; then he would show her that she had been frightened
by a mere dead thing, and she would feel ashamed of herself, and be
healed of her folly.&nbsp; It was the sort of idea that would occur
to a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he reached home, he took the dead snake into his smoking-room;
then, locking the door, the idiot set out his prescription.&nbsp; He
arranged the monster in a very natural and life-like position.&nbsp;
It appeared to be crawling from the open window across the floor, and
any one coming into the room suddenly could hardly avoid treading on
it.&nbsp; It was very cleverly done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That finished, he picked out a book from the shelves, opened
it, and laid it face downward upon the couch.&nbsp; When he had completed
all things to his satisfaction he unlocked the door and came out, very
pleased with himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dinner he lit a cigar and sat smoking a while in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you feeling tired?&rsquo; he said to her at length,
with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She laughed, and, calling him a lazy old thing, asked what
it was he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only my novel that I was reading.&nbsp; I left it in
my den.&nbsp; Do you mind?&nbsp; You will find it open on the couch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sprang up and ran lightly to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she paused there for a moment to look back at him and ask
the name of the book, he thought how pretty and how sweet she was; and
for the first time a faint glimmer of the true nature of the thing he
was doing forced itself into his brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; he said, half rising, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo;;
then, enamoured of the brilliancy of his plan, checked himself; and
she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard her footsteps passing along the matted passage, and
smiled to himself.&nbsp; He thought the affair was going to be rather
amusing.&nbsp; One finds it difficult to pity him even now when one
thinks of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoking-room door opened and closed, and he still sat
gazing dreamily at the ash of his cigar, and smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, perhaps two passed, but the time seemed much longer.&nbsp;
The man blew the gray cloud from before his eyes and waited.&nbsp; Then
he heard what he had been expecting to hear&mdash;a piercing shriek.&nbsp;
Then another, which, expecting to hear the clanging of the distant door
and the scurrying back of her footsteps along the passage, puzzled him,
so that the smile died away from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then another, and another, and another, shriek after shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The native servant, gliding noiselessly about the room, laid
down the thing that was in his hand and moved instinctively towards
the door.&nbsp; The man started up and held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep where you are,&rsquo; he said hoarsely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is nothing.&nbsp; Your mistress is frightened, that is all.&nbsp;
She must learn to get over this folly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he listened
again, and the shrieks ended with what sounded curiously like a smothered
laugh; and there came a sudden silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And out of that bottomless silence, Fear for the first time
in his life came to the man, and he and the dusky servant looked at
each other with eyes in which there was a strange likeness; and by a
common instinct moved together towards the place where the silence came
from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the man opened the door he saw three things: one was
the dead python, lying where he had left it; the second was a live python,
its comrade apparently, slowly crawling round it; the third a crushed,
bloody heap in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He himself remembered nothing more until, weeks afterwards,
he opened his eyes in a darkened, unfamiliar place, but the native servant,
before he fled screaming from the house, saw his master fling himself
upon the living serpent and grasp it with his hands, and when, later
on, others burst into the room and caught him staggering in their arms,
they found the second python with its head torn off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the incident that changed the character of my man&mdash;if
it be changed,&rdquo; concluded Jephson.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told it me
one night as we sat on the deck of the steamer, returning from Bombay.&nbsp;
He did not spare himself.&nbsp; He told me the story, much as I have
told it to you, but in an even, monotonous tone, free from emotion of
any kind.&nbsp; I asked him, when he had finished, how he could bear
to recall it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Recall it!&rsquo; he replied, with a slight accent
of surprise; &lsquo;it is always with me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>One day we spoke of crime and criminals.&nbsp; We had discussed the
possibility of a novel without a villain, but had decided that it would
be uninteresting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a terribly sad reflection,&rdquo; remarked MacShaughnassy,
musingly; &ldquo;but what a desperately dull place this earth would
be if it were not for our friends the bad people.&nbsp; Do you know,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;when I hear of folks going about the world trying
to reform everybody and make them good, I get positively nervous.&nbsp;
Once do away with sin, and literature will become a thing of the past.&nbsp;
Without the criminal classes we authors would starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; replied Jephson, drily; &ldquo;one
half mankind has been &lsquo;reforming&rsquo; the other half pretty
steadily ever since the Creation, yet there appears to be a fairly appreciable
amount of human nature left in it, notwithstanding.&nbsp; Suppressing
sin is much the same sort of task that suppressing a volcano would be&mdash;plugging
one vent merely opens another.&nbsp; Evil will last our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot take your optimistic view of the case,&rdquo; answered
MacShaughnassy.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me that crime&mdash;at all
events, interesting crime&mdash;is being slowly driven out of our existence.&nbsp;
Pirates and highwaymen have been practically abolished.&nbsp; Dear old
&lsquo;Smuggler Bill&rsquo; has melted down his cutlass into a pint-can
with a false bottom.&nbsp; The pressgang that was always so ready to
rescue our hero from his approaching marriage has been disbanded.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s not a lugger fit for the purposes of abduction left upon
the coast.&nbsp; Men settle their &lsquo;affairs of honour&rsquo; in
the law courts, and return home wounded only in the pocket.&nbsp; Assaults
on unprotected females are confined to the slums, where heroes do not
dwell, and are avenged by the nearest magistrate.&nbsp; Your modern
burglar is generally an out-of-work green-grocer.&nbsp; His &lsquo;swag&rsquo;
usually consists of an overcoat and a pair of boots, in attempting to
make off with which he is captured by the servant-girl.&nbsp; Suicides
and murders are getting scarcer every season.&nbsp; At the present rate
of decrease, deaths by violence will be unheard of in another decade,
and a murder story will be laughed at as too improbable to be interesting.&nbsp;
A certain section of busybodies are even crying out for the enforcement
of the seventh commandment.&nbsp; If they succeed authors will have
to follow the advice generally given to them by the critics, and retire
from business altogether.&nbsp; I tell you our means of livelihood are
being filched from us one by one.&nbsp; Authors ought to form themselves
into a society for the support and encouragement of crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s leading intention in making these remarks
was to shock and grieve Brown, and in this object he succeeded.&nbsp;
Brown is&mdash;or was, in those days&mdash;an earnest young man with
an exalted&mdash;some were inclined to say an exaggerated&mdash;view
of the importance and dignity of the literary profession.&nbsp; Brown&rsquo;s
notion of the scheme of Creation was that God made the universe so as
to give the literary man something to write about.&nbsp; I used at one
time to credit Brown with originality for this idea; but as I have grown
older I have learned that the theory is a very common and popular one
in cultured circles.</p>
<p>Brown expostulated with MacShaughnassy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You speak,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;as though literature were the parasite of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what else is she?&rdquo; replied the MacShaughnassy, with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would become of literature without folly
and sin?&nbsp; What is the work of the literary man but raking a living
for himself out of the dust-heap of human woe?&nbsp; Imagine, if you
can, a perfect world&mdash;a world where men and women never said foolish
things and never did unwise ones; where small boys were never mischievous
and children never made awkward remarks; where dogs never fought and
cats never screeched; where wives never henpecked their husbands and
mothers-in-law never nagged; where men never went to bed in their boots
and sea-captains never swore; where plumbers understood their work and
old maids never dressed as girls; where niggers never stole chickens
and proud men were never sea-sick! where would be your humour and your
wit?&nbsp; Imagine a world where hearts were never bruised; where lips
were never pressed with pain; where eyes were never dim; where feet
were never weary; where stomachs were never empty! where would be your
pathos?&nbsp; Imagine a world where husbands never loved more wives
than one, and that the right one; where wives were never kissed but
by their husbands; where men&rsquo;s hearts were never black and women&rsquo;s
thoughts never impure; where there was no hating and no envying; no
desiring; no despairing! where would be your scenes of passion, your
interesting complications, your subtle psychological analyses?&nbsp;
My dear Brown, we writers&mdash;novelists, dramatists, poets&mdash;we
fatten on the misery of our fellow-creatures.&nbsp; God created man
and woman, and the woman created the literary man when she put her teeth
into the apple.&nbsp; We came into the world under the shadow of the
serpent.&nbsp; We are special correspondents with the Devil&rsquo;s
army.&nbsp; We report his victories in our three-volume novels, his
occasional defeats in our five-act melodramas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which is very true,&rdquo; remarked Jephson; &ldquo;but
you must remember it is not only the literary man who traffics in misfortune.&nbsp;
The doctor, the lawyer, the preacher, the newspaper proprietor, the
weather prophet, will hardly, I should say, welcome the millennium.&nbsp;
I shall never forget an anecdote my uncle used to relate, dealing with
the period when he was chaplain of the Lincolnshire county jail.&nbsp;
One morning there was to be a hanging; and the usual little crowd of
witnesses, consisting of the sheriff, the governor, three or four reporters,
a magistrate, and a couple of warders, was assembled in the prison.&nbsp;
The condemned man, a brutal ruffian who had been found guilty of murdering
a young girl under exceptionally revolting circumstances, was being
pinioned by the hangman and his assistant; and my uncle was employing
the last few moments at his disposal in trying to break down the sullen
indifference the fellow had throughout manifested towards both his crime
and his fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle failing to make any impression upon him, the governor
ventured to add a few words of exhortation, upon which the man turned
fiercely on the whole of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go to hell,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;with your snivelling
jaw.&nbsp; Who are you, to preach at me?&nbsp; <i>You&rsquo;re</i> glad
enough I&rsquo;m here&mdash;all of you.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m the only
one of you as ain&rsquo;t going to make a bit over this job.&nbsp; Where
would you all be, I should like to know, you canting swine, if it wasn&rsquo;t
for me and my sort?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s the likes of me as <i>keeps</i>
the likes of you,&rsquo; with which he walked straight to the gallows
and told the hangman to &lsquo;hurry up&rsquo; and not keep the gentlemen
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some &lsquo;grit&rsquo; in that man,&rdquo; said
MacShaughnassy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Jephson, &ldquo;and wholesome wit also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacShaughnassy puffed a mouthful of smoke over a spider which was
just about to kill a fly.&nbsp; This caused the spider to fall into
the river, from where a supper-hunting swallow quickly rescued him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of a scene I once witnessed
in the office of <i>The Daily</i>&mdash;well, in the office of a certain
daily newspaper.&nbsp; It was the dead season, and things were somewhat
slow.&nbsp; An endeavour had been made to launch a discussion on the
question &lsquo;Are Babies a Blessing?&rsquo;&nbsp; The youngest reporter
on the staff, writing over the simple but touching signature of &lsquo;Mother
of Six,&rsquo; had led off with a scathing, though somewhat irrelevant,
attack upon husbands, as a class; the Sporting Editor, signing himself
&lsquo;Working Man,&rsquo; and garnishing his contribution with painfully
elaborated orthographical lapses, arranged to give an air of verisimilitude
to the correspondence, while, at the same time, not to offend the susceptibilities
of the democracy (from whom the paper derived its chief support), had
replied, vindicating the British father, and giving what purported to
be stirring midnight experiences of his own.&nbsp; The Gallery Man,
calling himself, with a burst of imagination, &lsquo;Gentleman and Christian,&rsquo;
wrote indignantly that he considered the agitation of the subject to
be both impious and indelicate, and added he was surprised that a paper
holding the exalted, and deservedly popular, position of <i>The</i>
--- should have opened its columns to the brainless vapourings of &lsquo;Mother
of Six&rsquo; and &lsquo;Working Man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The topic had, however, fallen flat.&nbsp; With the exception
of one man who had invented a new feeding-bottle, and thought he was
going to advertise it for nothing, the outside public did not respond,
and over the editorial department gloom had settled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening, as two or three of us were mooning about the
stairs, praying secretly for a war or a famine, Todhunter, the town
reporter, rushed past us with a cheer, and burst into the Sub-editor&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; We followed.&nbsp; He was waving his notebook above his
head, and clamouring, after the manner of people in French exercises,
for pens, ink, and paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; cried the Sub-editor, catching
his enthusiasm; &lsquo;influenza again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Better than that!&rsquo; shouted Todhunter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Excursion
steamer run down, a hundred and twenty-five lives lost&mdash;four good
columns of heartrending scenes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; said the Sub, &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t
have happened at a better time either&rsquo;&mdash;and then he sat down
and dashed off a leaderette, in which he dwelt upon the pain and regret
the paper felt at having to announce the disaster, and drew attention
to the exceptionally harrowing account provided by the energy and talent
of &lsquo;our special reporter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the law of nature,&rdquo; said Jephson: &ldquo;we are
not the first party of young philosophers who have been struck with
the fact that one man&rsquo;s misfortune is another man&rsquo;s opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occasionally, another woman&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>I was thinking of an incident told me by a nurse.&nbsp; If a nurse
in fair practice does not know more about human nature&mdash;does not
see clearer into the souls of men and women than all the novelists in
little Bookland put together&mdash;it must be because she is physically
blind and deaf.&nbsp; All the world&rsquo;s a stage, and all the men
and women merely players; so long as we are in good health, we play
our parts out bravely to the end, acting them, on the whole, artistically
and with strenuousness, even to the extent of sometimes fancying ourselves
the people we are pretending to be.&nbsp; But with sickness comes forgetfulness
of our part, and carelessness of the impression we are making upon the
audience.&nbsp; We are too weak to put the paint and powder on our faces,
the stage finery lies unheeded by our side.&nbsp; The heroic gestures,
the virtuous sentiments are a weariness to us.&nbsp; In the quiet, darkened
room, where the foot-lights of the great stage no longer glare upon
us, where our ears are no longer strained to catch the clapping or the
hissing of the town, we are, for a brief space, ourselves.</p>
<p>This nurse was a quiet, demure little woman, with a pair of dreamy,
soft gray eyes that had a curious power of absorbing everything that
passed before them without seeming to look at anything.&nbsp; Gazing
upon much life, laid bare, had given to them a slightly cynical expression,
but there was a background of kindliness behind.</p>
<p>During the evenings of my convalescence she would talk to me of her
nursing experiences.&nbsp; I have sometimes thought I would put down
in writing the stories that she told me, but they would be sad reading.&nbsp;
The majority of them, I fear, would show only the tangled, seamy side
of human nature, and God knows there is little need for us to point
that out to each other, though so many nowadays seem to think it the
only work worth doing.&nbsp; A few of them were sweet, but I think they
were the saddest; and over one or two a man might laugh, but it would
not be a pleasant laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never enter the door of a house to which I have been summoned,&rdquo;
she said to me one evening, &ldquo;without wondering, as I step over
the threshold, what the story is going to be.&nbsp; I always feel inside
a sick-room as if I were behind the scenes of life.&nbsp; The people
come and go about you, and you listen to them talking and laughing,
and you look into your patient&rsquo;s eyes, and you just know that
it&rsquo;s all a play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident that Jephson&rsquo;s remark had reminded me of, she
told me one afternoon, as I sat propped up by the fire, trying to drink
a glass of port wine, and feeling somewhat depressed at discovering
I did not like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my first cases,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was a surgical
operation.&nbsp; I was very young at the time, and I made rather an
awkward mistake&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean a professional mistake&mdash;but
a mistake nevertheless that I ought to have had more sense than to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patient was a good-looking, pleasant-spoken gentleman.&nbsp;
The wife was a pretty, dark little woman, but I never liked her from
the first; she was one of those perfectly proper, frigid women, who
always give me the idea that they were born in a church, and have never
got over the chill.&nbsp; However, she seemed very fond of him, and
he of her; and they talked very prettily to each other&mdash;too prettily
for it to be quite genuine, I should have said, if I&rsquo;d known as
much of the world then as I do now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The operation was a difficult and dangerous one.&nbsp; When
I came on duty in the evening I found him, as I expected, highly delirious.&nbsp;
I kept him as quiet as I could, but towards nine o&rsquo;clock, as the
delirium only increased, I began to get anxious.&nbsp; I bent down close
to him and listened to his ravings.&nbsp; Over and over again I heard
the name &lsquo;Louise.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Louise&rsquo;
come to him?&nbsp; It was so unkind of her&mdash;they had dug a great
pit, and were pushing him down into it&mdash;oh! why didn&rsquo;t she
come and save him?&nbsp; He should be saved if she would only come and
take his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His cries became so pitiful that I could bear them no longer.&nbsp;
His wife had gone to attend a prayer-meeting, but the church was only
in the next street.&nbsp; Fortunately, the day-nurse had not left the
house: I called her in to watch him for a minute, and, slipping on my
bonnet, ran across.&nbsp; I told my errand to one of the vergers and
he took me to her.&nbsp; She was kneeling, but I could not wait.&nbsp;
I pushed open the pew door, and, bending down, whispered to her, &lsquo;Please
come over at once; your husband is more delirious than I quite care
about, and you may be able to calm him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She whispered back, without raising her head, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
be over in a little while.&nbsp; The meeting won&rsquo;t last much longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her answer surprised and nettled me.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
be acting more like a Christian woman by coming home with me,&rsquo;
I said sharply, &lsquo;than by stopping here.&nbsp; He keeps calling
for you, and I can&rsquo;t get him to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She raised her head from her hands: &lsquo;Calling for me?&rsquo;
she asked, with a slightly incredulous accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;it has been his one cry
for the last hour: Where&rsquo;s Louise, why doesn&rsquo;t Louise come
to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her face was in shadow, but as she turned it away, and the
faint light from one of the turned-down gas-jets fell across it, I fancied
I saw a smile upon it, and I disliked her more than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come back with you,&rsquo; she said, rising
and putting her books away, and we left the church together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She asked me many questions on the way: Did patients, when
they were delirious, know the people about them?&nbsp; Did they remember
actual facts, or was their talk mere incoherent rambling?&nbsp; Could
one guide their thoughts in any way?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment we were inside the door, she flung off her bonnet
and cloak, and came upstairs quickly and softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She walked to the bedside, and stood looking down at him,
but he was quite unconscious of her presence, and continued muttering.&nbsp;
I suggested that she should speak to him, but she said she was sure
it would be useless, and drawing a chair back into the shadow, sat down
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing she was no good to him, I tried to persuade her to
go to bed, but she said she would rather stop, and I, being little more
than a girl then, and without much authority, let her.&nbsp; All night
long he tossed and raved, the one name on his lips being ever Louise&mdash;Louise&mdash;and
all night long that woman sat there in the shadow, never moving, never
speaking, with a set smile on her lips that made me long to take her
by the shoulders and shake her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time he imagined himself back in his courting days,
and pleaded, &lsquo;Say you love me, Louise.&nbsp; I know you do.&nbsp;
I can read it in your eyes.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of our pretending?&nbsp;
We <i>know</i> each other.&nbsp; Put your white arms about me.&nbsp;
Let me feel your breath upon my neck.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I knew it, my
darling, my love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole house was deadly still, and I could hear every word
of his troubled ravings.&nbsp; I almost felt as if I had no right to
be there, listening to them, but my duty held me.&nbsp; Later on, he
fancied himself planning a holiday with her, so I concluded.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall start on Monday evening,&rsquo; he was saying, and you can join
me in Dublin at Jackson&rsquo;s Hotel on the Wednesday, and we&rsquo;ll
go straight on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His voice grew a little faint, and his wife moved forward
on her chair, and bent her head closer to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he continued, after a pause, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
no danger whatever.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lonely little place, right in
the heart of the Galway Mountains&mdash;O&rsquo;Mullen&rsquo;s Half-way
House they call it&mdash;five miles from Ballynahinch.&nbsp; We shan&rsquo;t
meet a soul there.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have three weeks of heaven all
to ourselves, my goddess, my Mrs. Maddox from Boston&mdash;don&rsquo;t
forget the name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed in his delirium; and the woman, sitting by his
side, laughed also; and then the truth flashed across me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran up to her and caught her by the arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
name&rsquo;s not Louise,&rsquo; I said, looking straight at her.&nbsp;
It was an impertinent interference, but I felt excited, and acted on
impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she replied, very quietly; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s
the name of a very dear school friend of mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got
the clue to-night that I&rsquo;ve been waiting two years to get.&nbsp;
Good-night, nurse, thanks for fetching me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She rose and went out, and I listened to her footsteps going
down the stairs, and then drew up the blind and let in the dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never told that incident to any one until this
evening,&rdquo; my nurse concluded, as she took the empty port wine
glass out of my hand, and stirred the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;A nurse wouldn&rsquo;t
get many engagements if she had the reputation for making blunders of
that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another story that she told me showed married life more lovelit,
but then, as she added, with that cynical twinkle which glinted so oddly
from her gentle, demure eyes, this couple had only very recently been
wed&mdash;had, in fact, only just returned from their honeymoon.</p>
<p>They had been travelling on the Continent, and there had both contracted
typhoid fever, which showed itself immediately on their home-coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was called in to them on the very day of their arrival,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;the husband was the first to take to his bed, and the
wife followed suit twelve hours afterwards.&nbsp; We placed them in
adjoining rooms, and, as often as was possible, we left the door ajar
so that they could call out to one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor things!&nbsp; They were little else than boy and girl,
and they worried more about each other than they thought about themselves.&nbsp;
The wife&rsquo;s only trouble was that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to
do anything for &lsquo;poor Jack.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, nurse, you
will be good to him, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; she would cry, with her
big childish eyes full of tears; and the moment I went in to him it
would be: &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t trouble about me, nurse, I&rsquo;m
all right.&nbsp; Just look after the wifie, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a hard time between the two of them, for, with the help
of her sister, I was nursing them both.&nbsp; It was an unprofessional
thing to do, but I could see they were not well off, and I assured the
doctor that I could manage.&nbsp; To me it was worth while going through
the double work just to breathe the atmosphere of unselfishness that
sweetened those two sick-rooms.&nbsp; The average invalid is not the
patient sufferer people imagine.&nbsp; It is a fretful, querulous, self-pitying
little world that we live in as a rule, and that we grow hard in.&nbsp;
It gave me a new heart, nursing these young people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man pulled through, and began steadily to recover, but
the wife was a wee slip of a girl, and her strength&mdash;what there
was of it&mdash;ebbed day by day.&nbsp; As he got stronger he would
call out more and more cheerfully to her through the open door, and
ask her how she was getting on, and she would struggle to call back
laughing answers.&nbsp; It had been a mistake to put them next to each
other, and I blamed myself for having done so, but it was too late to
change then.&nbsp; All we could do was to beg her not to exhaust herself,
and to let us, when he called out, tell him she was asleep.&nbsp; But
the thought of not answering him or calling to him made her so wretched
that it seemed safer to let her have her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her one anxiety was that he should not know how weak she was.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It will worry him so,&rsquo; she would say; &lsquo;he is such
an old fidget over me.&nbsp; And I <i>am</i> getting stronger, slowly;
ain&rsquo;t I, nurse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning he called out to her, as usual, asking her how
she was, and she answered, though she had to wait for a few seconds
to gather strength to do so.&nbsp; He seemed to detect the effort, for
he called back anxiously, &lsquo;Are you <i>sure</i> you&rsquo;re all
right, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;getting on famously.&nbsp;
Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought your voice sounded a little weak, dear,&rsquo;
he answered; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t call out if it tries you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for the first time she began to worry about herself&mdash;not
for her own sake, but because of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think I <i>am</i> getting weaker, nurse?&rsquo;
she asked me, fixing her great eyes on me with a frightened look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re making yourself weak by calling out,&rsquo;
I answered, a little sharply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall have to keep that
door shut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell him&rsquo;&mdash;that was all
her thought&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t let him know it.&nbsp; Tell him
I&rsquo;m strong, won&rsquo;t you, nurse?&nbsp; It will kill him if
he thinks I&rsquo;m not getting well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was glad when her sister came up, and I could get out of
the room, for you&rsquo;re not much good at nursing when you feel, as
I felt then, as though you had swallowed a tablespoon and it was sticking
in your throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on, when I went in to him, he drew me to the bedside,
and whispered me to tell him truly how she was.&nbsp; If you are telling
a lie at all, you may just as well make it a good one, so I told him
she was really wonderfully well, only a little exhausted after the illness,
as was natural, and that I expected to have her up before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lad! that lie did him more good than a week&rsquo;s doctoring
and nursing; and next morning he called out more cheerily than ever
to her, and offered to bet her a new bonnet against a new hat that he
would race her, and be up first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She laughed back quite merrily (I was in his room at the time).&nbsp;
&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll lose.&nbsp; I
shall be well first, and I shall come and visit you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her laugh was so bright, and her voice sounded so much stronger,
that I really began to think she had taken a turn for the better, so
that when on going in to her I found her pillow wet with tears, I could
not understand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, we were so cheerful just a minute ago,&rsquo;
I said; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, poor Jack!&rsquo; she moaned, as her little, wasted
fingers opened and closed upon the counterpane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Jack,
it will break his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no good my saying anything.&nbsp; There comes a moment
when something tells your patient all that is to be known about the
case, and the doctor and the nurse can keep their hopeful assurances
for where they will be of more use.&nbsp; The only thing that would
have brought comfort to her then would have been to convince her that
he would soon forget her and be happy without her.&nbsp; I thought it
at the time, and I tried to say something of the kind to her, but I
couldn&rsquo;t get it out, and she wouldn&rsquo;t have believed me if
I had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So all I could do was to go back to the other room, and tell
him that I wanted her to go to sleep, and that he must not call out
to her until I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lay very still all day.&nbsp; The doctor came at his usual
hour and looked at her.&nbsp; He patted her hand, and just glanced at
the untouched food beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
worry her, nurse.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towards evening she opened her eyes, and beckoned to her sister,
who was standing by the bedside, to bend down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jeanie,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;do you think it
wrong to deceive any one when it&rsquo;s for their own good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the girl, in a dry
voice; &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; Why do you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jeanie, your voice was always very much like mine&mdash;do
you remember, they used to mistake us at home.&nbsp; Jeanie, call out
for me&mdash;just till&mdash;till he&rsquo;s a bit better; promise me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had loved each other, those two, more than is common
among sisters.&nbsp; Jeanie could not answer, but she pressed her sister
closer in her arms, and the other was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, drawing all her little stock of life together for one
final effort, the child raised herself in her sister&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night, Jack,&rsquo; she called out, loud and clear
enough to be heard through the closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night, little wife,&rsquo; he cried back, cheerily;
&lsquo;are you all right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, dear.&nbsp; Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her little, worn-out frame dropped back upon the bed, and
the next thing I remember is snatching up a pillow, and holding it tight-pressed
against Jeanie&rsquo;s face for fear the sound of her sobs should penetrate
into the next room; and afterwards we both got out, somehow, by the
other door, and rushed downstairs, and clung to each other in the back
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How we two women managed to keep up the deceit, as, for three
whole days, we did, I shall never myself know.&nbsp; Jeanie sat in the
room where her dead sister, from its head to its sticking-up feet, lay
outlined under the white sheet; and I stayed beside the living man,
and told lies and acted lies, till I took a joy in them, and had to
guard against the danger of over-elaborating them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wondered at what he thought my &lsquo;new merry mood,&rsquo;
and I told him it was because of my delight that his wife was out of
danger; and then I went on for the pure devilment of the thing, and
told him that a week ago, when we had let him think his wife was growing
stronger, we had been deceiving him; that, as a matter of fact, she
was at that time in great peril, and I had been in hourly alarm concerning
her, but that now the strain was over, and she was safe; and I dropped
down by the foot of the bed, and burst into a fit of laughter, and had
to clutch hold of the bedstead to keep myself from rolling on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had started up in bed with a wild white face when Jeanie
had first answered him from the other room, though the sisters&rsquo;
voices had been so uncannily alike that I had never been able to distinguish
one from the other at any time.&nbsp; I told him the slight change was
the result of the fever, that his own voice also was changed a little,
and that such was always the case with a person recovering from a long
illness.&nbsp; To guide his thoughts away from the real clue, I told
him Jeanie had broken down with the long work, and that, the need for
her being past, I had packed her off into the country for a short rest.&nbsp;
That afternoon we concocted a letter to him, and I watched Jeanie&rsquo;s
eyes with a towel in my hand while she wrote it, so that no tears should
fall on it, and that night she travelled twenty miles down the Great
Western line to post it, returning by the next up-train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No suspicion of the truth ever occurred to him, and the doctor
helped us out with our deception; yet his pulse, which day by day had
been getting stronger, now beat feebler every hour.&nbsp; In that part
of the country where I was born and grew up, the folks say that wherever
the dead lie, there round about them, whether the time be summer or
winter, the air grows cold and colder, and that no fire, though you
pile the logs half-way up the chimney, will ever make it warm.&nbsp;
A few months&rsquo; hospital training generally cures one of all fanciful
notions about death, but this idea I have never been able to get rid
of.&nbsp; My thermometer may show me sixty, and I may try to believe
that the temperature <i>is</i> sixty, but if the dead are beside me
I feel cold to the marrow of my bones.&nbsp; I could <i>see</i> the
chill from the dead room crawling underneath the door, and creeping
up about his bed, and reaching out its hand to touch his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanie and I redoubled our efforts, for it seemed to us as
if Death were waiting just outside in the passage, watching with his
eye at the keyhole for either of us to make a blunder and let the truth
slip out.&nbsp; I hardly ever left his side except now and again to
go into that next room, and poke an imaginary fire, and say a few chaffing
words to an imaginary living woman on the bed where the dead one lay;
and Jeanie sat close to the corpse, and called out saucy messages to
him, or reassuring answers to his anxious questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At times, knowing that if we stopped another moment in these
rooms we should scream, we would steal softly out and rush downstairs,
and, shutting ourselves out of hearing in a cellar underneath the yard,
laugh till we reeled against the dirty walls.&nbsp; I think we were
both getting a little mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day&mdash;it was the third of that nightmare life, so
I learned afterwards, though for all I could have told then it might
have been the three hundredth, for Time seemed to have fled from that
house as from a dream, so that all things were tangled&mdash;I made
a slip that came near to ending the matter, then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had gone into that other room.&nbsp; Jeanie had left her
post for a moment, and the place was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think what I was doing.&nbsp; I had not closed my
eyes that I can remember since the wife had died, and my brain and my
senses were losing their hold of one another.&nbsp; I went through my
usual performance of talking loudly to the thing underneath the white
sheet, and noisily patting the pillows and rattling the bottles on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my return, he asked me how she was, and I answered, half
in a dream, &lsquo;Oh, bonny, she&rsquo;s trying to read a little,&rsquo;
and he raised himself on his elbow and called out to her, and for answer
there came back silence&mdash;not the silence that <i>is</i> silence,
but the silence that is as a voice.&nbsp; I do not know if you understand
what I mean by that.&nbsp; If you had lived among the dead as long as
I have, you would know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I darted to the door and pretended to look in.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
fallen asleep,&rsquo; I whispered, closing it; and he said nothing,
but his eyes looked queerly at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night, Jeanie and I stood in the hall talking.&nbsp;
He had fallen to sleep early, and I had locked the door between the
two rooms, and put the key in my pocket, and had stolen down to tell
her what had happened, and to consult with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What can we do!&nbsp; God help us, what can we do!&rsquo;
was all that Jeanie could say.&nbsp; We had thought that in a day or
two he would be stronger, and that the truth might be broken to him.&nbsp;
But instead of that he had grown so weak, that to excite his suspicions
now by moving him or her would be to kill him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stood looking blankly in each other&rsquo;s faces, wondering
how the problem could be solved; and while we did so the problem solved
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one woman-servant had gone out, and the house was very
silent&mdash;so silent that I could hear the ticking of Jeanie&rsquo;s
watch inside her dress.&nbsp; Suddenly, into the stillness there came
a sound.&nbsp; It was not a cry.&nbsp; It came from no human voice.&nbsp;
I have heard the voice of human pain till I know its every note, and
have grown careless to it; but I have prayed God on my knees that I
may never hear that sound again, for it was the sob of a soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wailed through the quiet house and passed away, and neither
of us stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, with the return of the blood to our veins, we went
upstairs together.&nbsp; He had crept from his own room along the passage
into hers.&nbsp; He had not had strength enough to pull the sheet off,
though he had tried.&nbsp; He lay across the bed with one hand grasping
hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>My nurse sat for a while without speaking, a somewhat unusual thing
for her to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to write your experiences,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, giving the fire a contemplative poke,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d seen as much sorrow in the world as I have, you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to write a sad book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she added, after a long pause, with the poker
still in her hand, &ldquo;it can only be the people who have never <i>known</i>
suffering who can care to read of it.&nbsp; If I could write a book,
I should write a merry book&mdash;a book that would make people laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>The discussion arose in this way.&nbsp; I had proposed a match between
our villain and the daughter of the local chemist, a singularly noble
and pure-minded girl, the humble but worthy friend of the heroine.</p>
<p>Brown had refused his consent on the ground of improbability.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What in thunder would induce him to marry <i>her</i>?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;love, that burns as brightly
in the meanest villain&rsquo;s breast as in the proud heart of the good
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to be light and amusing,&rdquo; returned Brown,
severely, &ldquo;or are you supposed to be discussing the matter seriously?&nbsp;
What attraction could such a girl have for such a man as Reuben Neil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every attraction,&rdquo; I retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is the
exact moral contrast to himself.&nbsp; She is beautiful (if she&rsquo;s
not beautiful enough, we can touch her up a bit), and, when the father
dies, there will be the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;it will make the thing seem
more natural if everybody wonders what on earth could have been the
reason for their marrying each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown wasted no further words on me, but turned to MacShaughnassy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can <i>you</i> imagine our friend Reuben seized with a burning
desire to marry Mary Holme?&rdquo; he asked, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can,&rdquo; said MacShaughnassy; &ldquo;I can
imagine anything, and believe anything of anybody.&nbsp; It is only
in novels that people act reasonably and in accordance with what might
be expected of them.&nbsp; I knew an old sea-captain who used to read
the <i>Young Ladies&rsquo; Journal</i> in bed, and cry over it.&nbsp;
I knew a bookmaker who always carried Browning&rsquo;s poems about with
him in his pocket to study in the train.&nbsp; I have known a Harley
Street doctor to develop at forty-eight a sudden and overmastering passion
for switchbacks, and to spend every hour he could spare from his practice
at one or other of the exhibitions, having three-pen&rsquo;orths one
after the other.&nbsp; I have known a book-reviewer give oranges (not
poisoned ones) to children.&nbsp; A man is not a character, he is a
dozen characters, one of them prominent, the other eleven more or less
undeveloped.&nbsp; I knew a man once, two of whose characters were of
equal value, and the consequences were peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We begged him to relate the case to us, and he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a Balliol man,&rdquo; said MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;and
his Christian name was Joseph.&nbsp; He was a member of the &lsquo;Devonshire&rsquo;
at the time I knew him, and was, I think, the most superior person I
have ever met.&nbsp; He sneered at the <i>Saturday Review</i> as the
pet journal of the suburban literary club; and at the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
as the trade organ of the unsuccessful writer.&nbsp; Thackeray, he considered,
was fairly entitled to his position of favourite author to the cultured
clerk; and Carlyle he regarded as the exponent of the earnest artisan.&nbsp;
Living authors he never read, but this did not prevent his criticising
them contemptuously.&nbsp; The only inhabitants of the nineteenth century
that he ever praised were a few obscure French novelists, of whom nobody
but himself had ever heard.&nbsp; He had his own opinion about God Almighty,
and objected to Heaven on account of the strong Clapham contingent likely
to be found in residence there.&nbsp; Humour made him sad, and sentiment
made him ill.&nbsp; Art irritated him and science bored him.&nbsp; He
despised his own family and disliked everybody else.&nbsp; For exercise
he yawned, and his conversation was mainly confined to an occasional
shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody liked him, but everybody respected him.&nbsp; One felt
grateful to him for his condescension in living at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One summer, I was fishing over the Norfolk Broads, and on
the Bank Holiday, thinking I would like to see the London &rsquo;Arry
in his glory, I ran over to Yarmouth.&nbsp; Walking along the sea-front
in the evening, I suddenly found myself confronted by four remarkably
choice specimens of the class.&nbsp; They were urging on their wild
and erratic career arm-in-arm.&nbsp; The one nearest the road was playing
an unusually wheezy concertina, and the other three were bawling out
the chorus of a music-hall song, the heroine of which appeared to be
&lsquo;Hemmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They spread themselves right across the pavement, compelling
all the women and children they met to step into the roadway.&nbsp;
I stood my ground on the kerb, and as they brushed by me something in
the face of the one with the concertina struck me as familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned and followed them.&nbsp; They were evidently enjoying
themselves immensely.&nbsp; To every girl they passed they yelled out,
&lsquo;Oh, you little jam tart!&rsquo; and every old lady they addressed
as &lsquo;Mar.&rsquo;&nbsp; The noisiest and the most vulgar of the
four was the one with the concertina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed them on to the pier, and then, hurrying past, waited
for them under a gas-lamp.&nbsp; When the man with the concertina came
into the light and I saw him clearly I started.&nbsp; From the face
I could have sworn it was Joseph; but everything else about him rendered
such an assumption impossible.&nbsp; Putting aside the time and the
place, and forgetting his behaviour, his companions, and his instrument,
what remained was sufficient to make the suggestion absurd.&nbsp; Joseph
was always clean shaven; this youth had a smudgy moustache and a pair
of incipient red whiskers.&nbsp; He was dressed in the loudest check
suit I have ever seen, off the stage.&nbsp; He wore patent-leather boots
with mother-of-pearl buttons, and a necktie that in an earlier age would
have called down lightning out of Heaven.&nbsp; He had a low-crowned
billycock hat on his head, and a big evil-smelling cigar between his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Argue as I would, however, the face was the face of Joseph;
and, moved by a curiosity I could not control, I kept near him, watching
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, for a little while, I missed him; but there was not
much fear of losing that suit for long, and after a little looking about
I struck it again.&nbsp; He was sitting at the end of the pier, where
it was less crowded, with his arm round a girl&rsquo;s waist.&nbsp;
I crept close.&nbsp; She was a jolly, red-faced girl, good-looking enough,
but common to the last degree.&nbsp; Her hat lay on the seat beside
her, and her head was resting on his shoulder.&nbsp; She appeared to
be fond of him, but he was evidently bored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;tcher like me, Joe?&rsquo; I heard her murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yas,&rsquo; he replied, somewhat unconvincingly, &lsquo;o&rsquo;
course I likes yer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave him an affectionate slap, but he did not respond,
and a few minutes afterwards, muttering some excuse, he rose and left
her, and I followed him as he made his way towards the refreshment-room.&nbsp;
At the door he met one of his pals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; was the question, &lsquo;wot &rsquo;a
yer done wi&rsquo; &rsquo;Liza?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I carn&rsquo;t stand &rsquo;er,&rsquo; was his
reply; &lsquo;she gives me the bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;ump.&nbsp; You
&rsquo;ave a turn with &rsquo;er.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His friend disappeared in the direction of &rsquo;Liza, and
Joe pushed into the room, I keeping close behind him.&nbsp; Now that
he was alone I was determined to speak to him.&nbsp; The longer I had
studied his features the more resemblance I had found in them to those
of my superior friend Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was leaning across the bar, clamouring for two of gin,
when I tapped him on the shoulder.&nbsp; He turned his head, and the
moment he saw me, his face went livid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Joseph Smythe, I believe,&rsquo; I said with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s Mr. Joseph Smythe?&rsquo; he answered hoarsely;
&lsquo;my name&rsquo;s Smith, I ain&rsquo;t no bloomin&rsquo; Smythe.&nbsp;
Who are you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know yer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he spoke, my eyes rested upon a curious gold ring of Indian
workmanship which he wore upon his left hand.&nbsp; There was no mistaking
the ring, at all events: it had been passed round the club on more than
one occasion as a unique curiosity.&nbsp; His eyes followed my gaze.&nbsp;
He burst into tears, and pushing me before him into a quiet corner of
the saloon, sat down facing me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give me away, old man,&rsquo; he whimpered;
&lsquo;for Gawd&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let on to any of the chaps
&rsquo;ere that I&rsquo;m a member of that blessed old waxwork show
in Saint James&rsquo;s: they&rsquo;d never speak to me agen.&nbsp; And
keep yer mug shut about Oxford, there&rsquo;s a good sort.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ave &rsquo;em know as &rsquo;ow I was one o&rsquo; them college
blokes for anythink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat aghast.&nbsp; I had listened to hear him entreat me
to keep &lsquo;Smith,&rsquo; the rorty &rsquo;Arry, a secret from the
acquaintances of &lsquo;Smythe,&rsquo; the superior person.&nbsp; Here
was &lsquo;Smith&rsquo; in mortal terror lest his pals should hear of
his identity with the aristocratic &lsquo;Smythe,&rsquo; and discard
him.&nbsp; His attitude puzzled me at the time, but, when I came to
reflect, my wonder was at myself for having expected the opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I carn&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it,&rsquo; he went on; &lsquo;I
&rsquo;ave to live two lives.&nbsp; &rsquo;Arf my time I&rsquo;m a stuck-up
prig, as orter be jolly well kicked&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At which times,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;I have
heard you express some extremely uncomplimentary opinions concerning
&rsquo;Arries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; he replied, in a voice betraying strong
emotion; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s so precious rough on me.&nbsp;
When I&rsquo;m a toff I despises myself, &rsquo;cos I knows that underneath
my sneering phiz I&rsquo;m a bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;Arry.&nbsp; When
I&rsquo;m an &rsquo;Arry, I &rsquo;ates myself &rsquo;cos I knows I&rsquo;m
a toff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you decide which character you prefer,
and stick to it?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;I carn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a rum thing, but whichever I am, sure as fate, &rsquo;bout
the end of a month I begin to get sick o&rsquo; myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can quite understand it,&rsquo; I murmured; &lsquo;I
should give way myself in a fortnight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been myself, now,&rsquo; he continued, without
noticing my remark, &lsquo;for somethin&rsquo; like ten days.&nbsp;
One mornin&rsquo;, in &rsquo;bout three weeks&rsquo; time, I shall get
up in my diggins in the Mile End Road, and I shall look round the room,
and at these clothes &rsquo;angin&rsquo; over the bed, and at this yer
concertina&rsquo; (he gave it an affectionate squeeze), &lsquo;and I
shall feel myself gettin&rsquo; scarlet all over.&nbsp; Then I shall
jump out o&rsquo; bed, and look at myself in the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
howling little cad,&rdquo; I shall say to myself, &ldquo;I have half
a mind to strangle you&rdquo;; and I shall shave myself, and put on
a quiet blue serge suit and a bowler &rsquo;at, tell my landlady to
keep my rooms for me till I comes back, slip out o&rsquo; the &rsquo;ouse,
and into the fust &rsquo;ansom I meets, and back to the Halbany.&nbsp;
And a month arter that, I shall come into my chambers at the Halbany,
fling Voltaire and Parini into the fire, shy me &rsquo;at at the bust
of good old &rsquo;Omer, slip on my blue suit agen, and back to the
Mile End Road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you explain your absence to both parties?&rsquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s simple enough,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I just tells my &rsquo;ousekeeper at the Halbany as I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; on the Continong; and my mates &rsquo;ere thinks I&rsquo;m
a traveller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody misses me much,&rsquo; he added, pathetically;
&lsquo;I hain&rsquo;t a partic&rsquo;larly fetchin&rsquo; sort o&rsquo;
bloke, either of me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sich an out-and-outer.&nbsp; When
I&rsquo;m an &rsquo;Arry, I&rsquo;m too much of an &rsquo;Arry, and
when I&rsquo;m a prig, I&rsquo;m a reg&rsquo;lar fust prize prig.&nbsp;
Seems to me as if I was two ends of a man without any middle.&nbsp;
If I could only mix myself up a bit more, I&rsquo;d be all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sniffed once or twice, and then he laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,
well,&rsquo; he said, casting aside his momentary gloom; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
all a game, and wot&rsquo;s the odds so long as yer &rsquo;appy.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ave a wet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declined the wet, and left him playing sentimental airs
to himself upon the concertina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One afternoon, about a month later, the servant came to me
with a card on which was engraved the name of &lsquo;Mr. Joseph Smythe.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I requested her to show him up.&nbsp; He entered with his usual air
of languid superciliousness, and seated himself in a graceful attitude
upon the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, as soon as the girl had closed
the door behind her, &lsquo;so you&rsquo;ve got rid of Smith?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sickly smile passed over his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
not mentioned it to any one?&rsquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not to a soul,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;though I confess
I often feel tempted to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I sincerely trust you never will,&rsquo; he said, in
a tone of alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can have no conception of the misery
the whole thing causes me.&nbsp; I cannot understand it.&nbsp; What
possible affinity there can be between myself and that disgusting little
snob passes my comprehension.&nbsp; I assure you, my dear Mac, the knowledge
that I was a ghoul, or a vampire, would cause me less nausea than the
reflection that I am one and the same with that odious little Whitechapel
bounder.&nbsp; When I think of him every nerve in my body&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think about him any more,&rsquo; I interrupted,
perceiving his strongly-suppressed emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t
come here to talk about him, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Let us dismiss him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;in a certain roundabout
way it is slightly connected with him.&nbsp; That is really my excuse
for inflicting the subject upon you.&nbsp; You are the only man I <i>can</i>
speak to about it&mdash;if I shall not bore you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not in the least,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
most interested.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he still hesitated, I asked him point-blank
what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He appeared embarrassed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is really very absurd
of me,&rsquo; he said, while the faintest suspicion of pink crossed
his usually colourless face; &lsquo;but I feel I must talk to somebody
about it.&nbsp; The fact is, my dear Mac, I am in love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Capital!&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m delighted
to hear it.&rsquo;&nbsp; (I thought it might make a man of him.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do I know the lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am inclined to think you must have seen her,&rsquo;
he replied; &lsquo;she was with me on the pier at Yarmouth that evening
you met me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not &rsquo;Liza!&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was she,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;Miss Elizabeth
Muggins.&rsquo;&nbsp; He dwelt lovingly upon the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you seemed&mdash;I really
could not help noticing, it was so pronounced&mdash;you seemed to positively
dislike her.&nbsp; Indeed, I gathered from your remark to a friend that
her society was distinctly distasteful to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To Smith,&rsquo; he corrected me.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
judge would that howling little blackguard be of a woman&rsquo;s worth!&nbsp;
The dislike of such a man as that is a testimonial to her merit!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I may be mistaken,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but she struck
me as a bit common.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She is not, perhaps, what the world would call a lady,&rsquo;
he admitted; &lsquo;but then, my dear Mac, my opinion of the world is
not such as to render <i>its</i> opinion of much value to me.&nbsp;
I and the world differ on most subjects, I am glad to say.&nbsp; She
is beautiful, and she is good, and she is my choice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a jolly enough little girl,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;and, I should say, affectionate; but have you considered, Smythe,
whether she is quite&mdash;what shall we say&mdash;quite as intellectual
as could be desired?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Really, to tell the truth, I have not troubled myself
much about her intellect,&rsquo; he replied, with one of his sneering
smiles.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no doubt that the amount of intellect absolutely
necessary to the formation of a British home, I shall be able to supply
myself.&nbsp; I have no desire for an intellectual wife.&nbsp; One is
compelled to meet tiresome people, but one does not live with them if
one can avoid it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he continued, reverting to his more natural
tone; &lsquo;the more I think of Elizabeth the more clear it becomes
to me that she is the one woman in the world for whom marriage with
me is possible.&nbsp; I perceive that to the superficial observer my
selection must appear extraordinary.&nbsp; I do not pretend to explain
it, or even to understand it.&nbsp; The study of mankind is beyond man.&nbsp;
Only fools attempt it.&nbsp; Maybe it is her contrast to myself that
attracts me.&nbsp; Maybe my, perhaps, too spiritual nature feels the
need of contact with her coarser clay to perfect itself.&nbsp; I cannot
tell.&nbsp; These things must always remain mysteries.&nbsp; I only
know that I love her&mdash;that, if any reliance is to be placed upon
instinct, she is the mate to whom Artemis is leading me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was clear that he was in love, and I therefore ceased to
argue with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You kept up your acquaintanceship with
her, then, after you&rsquo;&mdash;I was going to say &lsquo;after you
ceased to be Smith,&rsquo; but not wishing to agitate him by more mention
of that person than I could help, I substituted, &lsquo;after you returned
to the Albany?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;I lost sight
of her after I left Yarmouth, and I did not see her again until five
days ago, when I came across her in an aerated bread shop.&nbsp; I had
gone in to get a glass of milk and a bun, and <i>she</i> brought them
to me.&nbsp; I recognised her in a moment.&rsquo;&nbsp; His face lighted
up with quite a human smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;I take tea there every afternoon
now,&rsquo; he added, glancing towards the clock, &lsquo;at four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not much need to ask <i>her</i> views
on the subject,&rsquo; I said, laughing; &lsquo;her feelings towards
you were pretty evident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, that is the curious part of it,&rsquo; he replied,
with a return to his former embarrassment; &lsquo;she does not seem
to care for me now at all.&nbsp; Indeed, she positively refuses me.&nbsp;
She says&mdash;to put it in the dear child&rsquo;s own racy language&mdash;that
she wouldn&rsquo;t take me on at any price.&nbsp; She says it would
be like marrying a clockwork figure without the key.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
more frank than complimentary, but I like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;an idea occurs
to me.&nbsp; Does she know of your identity with Smith?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he replied, alarmed, &lsquo;I would not
have her know it for worlds.&nbsp; Only yesterday she told me that I
reminded her of a fellow she had met at Yarmouth, and my heart was in
my mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How did she look when she told you that?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How did she look?&rsquo; he repeated, not understanding
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What was her expression at that moment?&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;was
it severe or tender?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;now I come to think
of it, she did seem to soften a bit just then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear boy,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the case is as clear
as daylight.&nbsp; She loves Smith.&nbsp; No girl who admired Smith
could be attracted by Smythe.&nbsp; As your present self you will never
win her.&nbsp; In a few weeks&rsquo; time, however, you will be Smith.&nbsp;
Leave the matter over until then.&nbsp; Propose to her as Smith, and
she will accept you.&nbsp; After marriage you can break Smythe gently
to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; he exclaimed, startled out of his customary
lethargy, &lsquo;I never thought of that.&nbsp; The truth is, when I
am in my right senses, Smith and all his affairs seem like a dream to
me.&nbsp; Any idea connected with him would never enter my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose and held out his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am so glad I
came to see you,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;your suggestion has almost reconciled
me to my miserable fate.&nbsp; Indeed, I quite look forward to a month
of Smith, now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so pleased,&rsquo; I answered, shaking hands
with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mind you come and tell me how you get on.&nbsp;
Another man&rsquo;s love affairs are not usually absorbing, but there
is an element of interest about yours that renders the case exceptional.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We parted, and I did not see him again for another month.&nbsp;
Then, late one evening, the servant knocked at my door to say that a
Mr. Smith wished to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Smith, Smith,&rsquo; I repeated; &lsquo;what Smith?
didn&rsquo;t he give you a card?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; answered the girl; &lsquo;he doesn&rsquo;t
look the sort that would have a card.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not a gentleman,
sir; but he says you&rsquo;ll know him.&rsquo;&nbsp; She evidently regarded
the statement as an aspersion upon myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to tell her to say I was out, when the recollection
of Smythe&rsquo;s other self flashed into my mind, and I directed her
to send him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minute passed, and then he entered.&nbsp; He was wearing
a new suit of a louder pattern, if possible, than before.&nbsp; I think
he must have designed it himself.&nbsp; He looked hot and greasy.&nbsp;
He did not offer to shake hands, but sat down awkwardly on the extreme
edge of a small chair, and gaped about the room as if he had never seen
it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He communicated his shyness to myself.&nbsp; I could not think
what to say, and we sat for a while in painful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, at last, plunging head-foremost
into the matter, according to the method of shy people, &lsquo;and how&rsquo;s
&rsquo;Liza?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> all right,&rsquo; he replied,
keeping his eyes fixed on his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you done it?&rsquo; I continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Done wot?&rsquo; he asked, looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Married her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered, returning to the contemplation
of his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Has she refused you then?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t arst &rsquo;er,&rsquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed unwilling to explain matters of his own accord.&nbsp;
I had to put the conversation into the form of a cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; I asked; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think
she cares for you any longer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He burst into a harsh laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t
much fear o&rsquo; that,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s like &rsquo;aving
an Alcock&rsquo;s porous plaster mashed on yer, blowed if it ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no gettin&rsquo; rid of &rsquo;er.&nbsp; I wish she&rsquo;d
giv&rsquo; somebody else a turn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fair sick of &rsquo;er.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you were enthusiastic about her a month ago!&rsquo;
I exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Smythe may &rsquo;ave been,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;there
ain&rsquo;t no accounting for that ninny, &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead&rsquo;s
full of starch.&nbsp; Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t take &rsquo;er on while
I&rsquo;m myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too jolly fly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That sort o&rsquo; gal&rsquo;s all right enough to
lark with,&rsquo; he continued; &lsquo;but yer don&rsquo;t want to marry
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t do yer no good.&nbsp; A man wants
a wife as &rsquo;e can respect&mdash;some one as is a cut above &rsquo;imself,
as will raise &rsquo;im up a peg or two&mdash;some one as &rsquo;e can
look up to and worship.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s wife orter be to &rsquo;im
a gawddess&mdash;a hangel, a&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You appear to have met the lady,&rsquo; I remarked,
interrupting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He blushed scarlet, and became suddenly absorbed in the pattern
of the carpet.&nbsp; But the next moment he looked up again, and his
face seemed literally transformed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mr. MacShaughnassy,&rsquo; he burst out,
with a ring of genuine manliness in his voice, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
know &rsquo;ow good, &rsquo;ow beautiful she is.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t
fit to breathe &rsquo;er name in my thoughts.&nbsp; An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s
so clever.&nbsp; I met &rsquo;er at that Toynbee &rsquo;All.&nbsp; There
was a party of toffs there all together.&nbsp; You would &rsquo;ave
enjoyed it, Mr. MacShaughnassy, if you could &rsquo;ave &rsquo;eard
&rsquo;er; she was makin&rsquo; fun of the pictures and the people round
about to &rsquo;er pa&mdash;such wit, such learnin&rsquo;, such &rsquo;aughtiness.&nbsp;
I follered them out and opened the carriage door for &rsquo;er, and
she just drew &rsquo;er skirt aside and looked at me as if I was the
dirt in the road.&nbsp; I wish I was, for then perhaps one day I&rsquo;d
kiss &rsquo;er feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His emotion was so genuine that I did not feel inclined to
laugh at him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you find out who she was?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;I &rsquo;eard the old
gentleman say &ldquo;&rsquo;Ome&rdquo; to the coachman, and I ran after
the carriage all the way to &rsquo;Arley Street.&nbsp; Trevior&rsquo;s
&rsquo;er name, Hedith Trevior.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Trevior!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;a tall, dark girl,
with untidy hair and rather weak eyes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tall and dark,&rsquo; he replied &lsquo;with &rsquo;air
that seems tryin&rsquo; to reach &rsquo;er lips to kiss &rsquo;em, and
heyes, light blue, like a Cambridge necktie.&nbsp; A &rsquo;undred and
seventy-three was the number.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;my dear Smith,
this is becoming complicated.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve met the lady and talked
to her for half an hour&mdash;as Smythe, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, after cogitating for a minute,
&lsquo;carn&rsquo;t say I do; I never can remember much about Smythe.&nbsp;
He allers seems to me like a bad dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you met her,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
positive.&nbsp; I introduced you to her myself, and she confided to
me afterwards that she thought you a most charming man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No&mdash;did she?&rsquo; he remarked, evidently softening
in his feelings towards Smythe; &lsquo;and did <i>I</i> like &rsquo;<i>er</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, to tell the truth,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think you did.&nbsp; You looked intensely bored.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Juggins,&rsquo; I heard him mutter to himself,
and then he said aloud: &lsquo;D&rsquo;yer think I shall get a chance
o&rsquo; seein&rsquo; &rsquo;er agen, when I&rsquo;m&mdash;when I&rsquo;m
Smythe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take you
round myself.&nbsp; By the bye,&rsquo; I added, jumping up and looking
on the mantelpiece, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a card for a Cinderella at
their place&mdash;something to do with a birthday.&nbsp; Will you be
Smythe on November the twentieth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&mdash;as,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;oh, yas&mdash;bound
to be by then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call
round for you at the Albany, and we&rsquo;ll go together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose and stood smoothing his hat with his sleeve.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fust time I&rsquo;ve ever looked for&rsquo;ard to bein&rsquo;
that hanimated corpse, Smythe,&rsquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Blowed
if I don&rsquo;t try to &rsquo;urry it up&mdash;&rsquo;pon my sivey
I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be no good to you till the twentieth,&rsquo;
I reminded him.&nbsp; &lsquo;And,&rsquo; I added, as I stood up to ring
the bell, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s a genuine case this time.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t be going back to &rsquo;Liza?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk &rsquo;bout &rsquo;Liza in the
same breath with Hedith,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;it sounds like sacrilege.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood hesitating with the handle of the door in his hand.&nbsp;
At last, opening it and looking very hard at his hat, he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to &rsquo;Arley Street now.&nbsp; I walk up and down outside
the &rsquo;ouse every evening, and sometimes, when there ain&rsquo;t
no one lookin&rsquo;, I get a chance to kiss the doorstep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He disappeared, and I returned to my chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On November twentieth, I called for him according to promise.&nbsp;
I found him on the point of starting for the club: he had forgotten
all about our appointment.&nbsp; I reminded him of it, and he with difficulty
recalled it, and consented, without any enthusiasm, to accompany me.&nbsp;
By a few artful hints to her mother (including a casual mention of his
income), I manoeuvred matters so that he had Edith almost entirely to
himself for the whole evening.&nbsp; I was proud of what I had done,
and as we were walking home together I waited to receive his gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it seemed slow in coming, I hinted my expectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I think I managed that
very cleverly for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Managed what very cleverly?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, getting you and Miss Trevior left together for
such a long time in the conservatory,&rsquo; I answered, somewhat hurt;
&lsquo;<i>I</i> fixed that for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it was <i>you</i>, was it,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
been cursing Providence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped dead in the middle of the pavement, and faced him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you love her?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Love her!&rsquo; he repeated, in the utmost astonishment;
&lsquo;what on earth is there in her to love?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s nothing
but a bad translation of a modern French comedy, with the interest omitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;tired&rsquo; me&mdash;to use an Americanism.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You came to me a month ago,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;raving over
her, and talking about being the dirt under her feet and kissing her
doorstep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned very red.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish, my dear Mac,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;you would pay me the compliment of not mistaking me
for that detestable little cad with whom I have the misfortune to be
connected.&nbsp; You would greatly oblige me if next time he attempts
to inflict upon you his vulgar drivel you would kindly kick him downstairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; he added, with a sneer, as we walked
on, &lsquo;Miss Trevior would be his ideal.&nbsp; She is exactly the
type of woman, I should say, to charm that type of man.&nbsp; For myself,
I do not appreciate the artistic and literary female.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; he continued, in a deeper tone, &lsquo;you
know my feelings.&nbsp; I shall never care for any other woman but Elizabeth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And she?&rsquo; I said</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She,&rsquo; he sighed, &lsquo;is breaking her heart
for Smith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell her you are Smith?&rsquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;not even to win
her.&nbsp; Besides, she would not believe me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said good-night at the corner of Bond Street, and I did
not see him again till one afternoon late in the following March, when
I ran against him in Ludgate Circus.&nbsp; He was wearing his transition
blue suit and bowler hat.&nbsp; I went up to him and took his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which are you?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither, for the moment,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;thank
God.&nbsp; Half an hour ago I was Smythe, half an hour hence I shall
be Smith.&nbsp; For the present half-hour I am a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a pleasant, hearty ring in his voice, and a genial,
kindly light in his eyes, and he held himself like a frank gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are certainly an improvement upon both of them,&rsquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed a sunny laugh, with just the shadow of sadness
dashed across it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know my idea of Heaven?&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I replied, somewhat surprised at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ludgate Circus,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
only really satisfying moments of my life,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;have
been passed in the neighbourhood of Ludgate Circus.&nbsp; I leave Piccadilly
an unhealthy, unwholesome prig.&nbsp; At Charing Cross I begin to feel
my blood stir in my veins.&nbsp; From Ludgate Circus to Cheapside I
am a human thing with human feeling throbbing in my heart, and human
thought throbbing in my brain&mdash;with fancies, sympathies, and hopes.&nbsp;
At the Bank my mind becomes a blank.&nbsp; As I walk on, my senses grow
coarse and blunted; and by the time I reach Whitechapel I am a poor
little uncivilised cad.&nbsp; On the return journey it is the same thing
reversed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why not live in Ludgate Circus,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and
be always as you are now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;man is a pendulum,
and must travel his arc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Mac,&rsquo; said he, laying his hand upon my
shoulder, &lsquo;there is only one good thing about me, and that is
a moral.&nbsp; Man is as God made him: don&rsquo;t be so sure that you
can take him to pieces and improve him.&nbsp; All my life I have sought
to make myself an unnaturally superior person.&nbsp; Nature has retaliated
by making me also an unnaturally inferior person.&nbsp; Nature abhors
lopsidedness.&nbsp; She turns out man as a whole, to be developed as
a whole.&nbsp; I always wonder, whenever I come across a supernaturally
pious, a supernaturally moral, a supernaturally cultured person, if
they also have a reverse self.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was shocked at his suggested argument, and walked by his
side for a while without speaking.&nbsp; At last, feeling curious on
the subject, I asked him how his various love affairs were progressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, as usual,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;in and out
of a <i>cul de sac</i>.&nbsp; When I am Smythe I love Eliza, and Eliza
loathes me.&nbsp; When I am Smith I love Edith, and the mere sight of
me makes her shudder.&nbsp; It is as unfortunate for them as for me.&nbsp;
I am not saying it boastfully.&nbsp; Heaven knows it is an added draught
of misery in my cup; but it is a fact that Eliza is literally pining
away for me as Smith, and&mdash;as Smith I find it impossible to be
even civil to her; while Edith, poor girl, has been foolish enough to
set her heart on me as Smythe, and as Smythe she seems to me but the
skin of a woman stuffed with the husks of learning, and rags torn from
the corpse of wit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remained absorbed in my own thoughts for some time, and
did not come out of them till we were crossing the Minories.&nbsp; Then,
the idea suddenly occurring to me, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a new girl altogether?&nbsp;
There must be medium girls that both Smith and Smythe could like, and
that would put up with both of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No more girls for this child,&rsquo; he answered &lsquo;they&rsquo;re
more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth.&nbsp; Those yer want yer carn&rsquo;t
get, and those yer can &rsquo;ave, yer don&rsquo;t want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started, and looked up at him.&nbsp; He was slouching along
with his hands in his pockets, and a vacuous look in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sudden repulsion seized me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must go now,&rsquo;
I said, stopping.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d no idea I had come so far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed as glad to be rid of me as I to be rid of him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, must yer,&rsquo; he said, holding out his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
so long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shook hands carelessly.&nbsp; He disappeared in the crowd,
and that is the last I have ever seen of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a true story?&rdquo; asked Jephson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve altered the names and dates,&rdquo; said
MacShaughnassy; &ldquo;but the main facts you can rely upon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>The final question discussed at our last meeting been: What shall
our hero be?&nbsp; MacShaughnassy had suggested an author, with a critic
for the villain.&nbsp; My idea was a stockbroker, with an undercurrent
of romance in his nature.&nbsp; Said Jephson, who has a practical mind:
&ldquo;The question is not what we like, but what the female novel-reader
likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; agreed MacShaughnassy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I propose
that we collect feminine opinion upon this point.&nbsp; I will write
to my aunt and obtain from her the old lady&rsquo;s view.&nbsp; You,&rdquo;
he said, turning to me, &ldquo;can put the case to your wife, and get
the young lady&rsquo;s ideal.&nbsp; Let Brown write to his sister at
Newnham, and find out whom the intellectual maiden favours, while Jephson
can learn from Miss Medbury what is most attractive to the common-sensed
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan we had adopted, and the result was now under consideration.&nbsp;
MacShaughnassy opened the proceedings by reading his aunt&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
Wrote the old lady:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think, if I were you, my dear boy, I should
choose a soldier.&nbsp; You know your poor grandfather, who ran away
to America with that <i>wicked</i> Mrs. Featherly, the banker&rsquo;s
wife, was a soldier, and so was your poor cousin Robert, who lost eight
thousand pounds at Monte Carlo.&nbsp; I have always felt singularly
drawn towards soldiers, even as a girl; though your poor dear uncle
could not bear them.&nbsp; You will find many allusions to soldiers
and men of war in the Old Testament (see Jer. xlviii. 14).&nbsp; Of
course one does not like to think of their fighting and killing each
other, but then they do not seem to do that sort of thing nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So much for the old lady,&rdquo; said MacShaughnassy, as he
folded up the letter and returned it to his pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
says culture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown produced from his cigar-case a letter addressed in a bold round
hand, and read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What a curious coincidence!&nbsp; A few of us
were discussing this very subject last night in Millicent Hightopper&rsquo;s
rooms, and I may tell you at once that our decision was unanimous in
favour of soldiers.&nbsp; You see, my dear Selkirk, in human nature
the attraction is towards the opposite.&nbsp; To a milliner&rsquo;s
apprentice a poet would no doubt be satisfying; to a woman of intelligence
he would he an unutterable bore.&nbsp; What the intellectual woman requires
in man is not something to argue with, but something to look at.&nbsp;
To an empty-headed woman I can imagine the soldier type proving vapid
and uninteresting; to the woman of mind he represents her ideal of man&mdash;a
creature strong, handsome, well-dressed, and not too clever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That gives us two votes for the army,&rdquo; remarked MacShaughnassy,
as Brown tore his sister&rsquo;s letter in two, and threw the pieces
into the waste-paper basket.&nbsp; &ldquo;What says the common-sensed
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First catch your common-sensed girl,&rdquo; muttered Jephson,
a little grumpily, as it seemed to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do you propose
finding her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;I looked to find
her in Miss Medbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule, the mention of Miss Medbury&rsquo;s name brings a flush
of joy to Jephson&rsquo;s face; but now his features wore an expression
distinctly approaching a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;did you?&nbsp; Well, then, the
common-sensed girl loves the military also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;what an extraordinary
thing.&nbsp; What reason does she give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there&rsquo;s a something about them, and that they dance
so divinely,&rdquo; answered Jephson, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you do surprise me,&rdquo; murmured MacShaughnassy,
&ldquo;I am astonished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to me he said: &ldquo;And what does the young married woman
say?&nbsp; The same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;precisely the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does <i>she</i> give a reason?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I explained; &ldquo;because you can&rsquo;t
help liking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for the next few minutes, while we smoked and thought.&nbsp;
I fancy we were all wishing we had never started this inquiry.</p>
<p>That four distinctly different types of educated womanhood should,
with promptness and unanimity quite unfeminine, have selected the soldier
as their ideal, was certainly discouraging to the civilian heart.&nbsp;
Had they been nursemaids or servant girls, I should have expected it.&nbsp;
The worship of Mars by the Venus of the white cap is one of the few
vital religions left to this devoutless age.&nbsp; A year or two ago
I lodged near a barracks, and the sight to be seen round its huge iron
gates on Sunday afternoons I shall never forget.&nbsp; The girls began
to assemble about twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; By two, at which hour
the army, with its hair nicely oiled and a cane in its hand, was ready
for a stroll, there would be some four or five hundred of them waiting
in a line.&nbsp; Formerly they had collected in a wild mob, and as the
soldiers were let out to them two at a time, had fought for them, as
lions for early Christians.&nbsp; This, however, had led to scenes of
such disorder and brutality, that the police had been obliged to interfere;
and the girls were now marshalled in <i>queue</i>, two abreast, and
compelled, by a force of constables specially told off for the purpose,
to keep their places and wait their proper turn.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the sentry on duty would come down to the
wicket and close it.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all gone, my dears,&rdquo;
he would shout out to the girls still left; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no good
your stopping, we&rsquo;ve no more for you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not one!&rdquo; some poor child would murmur pleadingly,
while the tears welled up into her big round eyes, &ldquo;not even a
little one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been waiting <i>such</i> a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; the honest fellow would reply,
gruffly, but not unkindly, turning aside to hide his emotion; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
had &rsquo;em all between you.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em,
you know: you can&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em if we haven&rsquo;t got &rsquo;em,
can you?&nbsp; Come earlier next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he would hurry away to escape further importunity; and the police,
who appeared to have been waiting for this moment with gloating anticipation,
would jeeringly hustle away the weeping remnant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then,
pass along, you girls, pass along,&rdquo; they would say, in that irritatingly
unsympathetic voice of theirs.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your chance.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t have the roadway blocked up all the afternoon with this
&rsquo;ere demonstration of the unloved.&nbsp; Pass along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with this same barracks, our char-woman told Amenda,
who told Ethelbertha, who told me a story, which I now told the boys.</p>
<p>Into a certain house, in a certain street in the neighbourhood, there
moved one day a certain family.&nbsp; Their servant had left them&mdash;most
of their servants did at the end of a week&mdash;and the day after the
moving-in an advertisement for a domestic was drawn up and sent to the
<i>Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; It ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>WANTED, GENERAL SERVANT, in small family of eleven.&nbsp;
Wages, &pound;6; no beer money.&nbsp; Must be early riser and hard worker.&nbsp;
Washing done at home.&nbsp; Must be good cook, and not object to window-cleaning.&nbsp;
Unitarian preferred.&mdash;Apply, with references, to A. B., etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That advertisement was sent off on Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp; At
seven o&rsquo;clock on Thursday morning the whole family were awakened
by continuous ringing of the street-door bell.&nbsp; The husband, looking
out of window, was surprised to see a crowd of about fifty girls surrounding
the house.&nbsp; He slipped on his dressing-gown and went down to see
what was the matter.&nbsp; The moment he opened the door, fifteen of
them charged tumultuously into the passage, sweeping him completely
off his legs.&nbsp; Once inside, these fifteen faced round, fought the
other thirty-five or so back on to the doorstep, and slammed the door
in their faces.&nbsp; Then they picked up the master of the house, and
asked him politely to conduct them to &ldquo;A. B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, owing to the clamour of the mob outside, who were hammering
at the door and shouting curses through the keyhole, he could understand
nothing, but at length they succeeded in explaining to him that they
were domestic servants come ill answer to his wife&rsquo;s advertisement.&nbsp;
The man went and told his wife, and his wife said she would see them,
one at a time.</p>
<p>Which one should have audience first was a delicate question to decide.&nbsp;
The man, on being appealed to, said he would prefer to leave it to them.&nbsp;
They accordingly discussed the matter among themselves.&nbsp; At the
end of a quarter of an hour, the victor, having borrowed some hair-pins
and a looking-glass from our char-woman, who had slept in the house,
went upstairs, while the remaining fourteen sat down in the hall, and
fanned themselves with their bonnets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. B.&rdquo; was a good deal astonished when the first applicant
presented herself.&nbsp; She was a tall, genteel-looking girl.&nbsp;
Up to yesterday she had been head housemaid at Lady Stanton&rsquo;s,
and before that she had been under-cook for two years to the Duchess
of York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you leave Lady Stanton?&rdquo; asked &ldquo;A.
B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To come here, mum,&rdquo; replied the girl.&nbsp; The lady
was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be satisfied with six pounds a year?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, mum, I think it ample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t mind hard work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love it, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re an early riser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, mum, it upsets me stopping in bed after half-past
five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we do the washing at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum.&nbsp; I think it so much better to do it at home.&nbsp;
Those laundries ruin good clothes.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re so careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a Unitarian?&rdquo; continued the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, mum,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;but I should
like to be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady took her reference, and said she would write.</p>
<p>The next applicant offered to come for three pounds&mdash;thought
six pounds too much.&nbsp; She expressed her willingness to sleep in
the back kitchen: a shakedown under the sink was all she wanted.&nbsp;
She likewise had yearnings towards Unitarianism.</p>
<p>The third girl did not require any wages at all&mdash;could not understand
what servants wanted with wages&mdash;thought wages only encouraged
a love of foolish finery&mdash;thought a comfortable home in a Unitarian
family ought to be sufficient wages for any girl.</p>
<p>This girl said there was one stipulation she should like to make,
and that was that she should be allowed to pay for all breakages caused
by her own carelessness or neglect.&nbsp; She objected to holidays and
evenings out; she held that they distracted a girl from her work.</p>
<p>The fourth candidate offered a premium of five pounds for the place;
and then &ldquo;A. B.&rdquo; began to get frightened, and refused to
see any more of the girls, convinced that they must be lunatics from
some neighbouring asylum out for a walk.</p>
<p>Later in the day, meeting the next-door lady on the doorstep, she
related her morning&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing extraordinary,&rdquo; said the next-door
lady; &ldquo;none of us on this side of the street pay wages; and we
get the pick of all the best servants in London.&nbsp; Why, girls will
come from the other end of the kingdom to get into one of these houses.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the dream of their lives.&nbsp; They save up for years, so
as to be able to come here for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the attraction?&rdquo; asked &ldquo;A. B.,&rdquo;
more amazed than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; explained the next door lady,
&ldquo;our back windows open upon the barrack yard.&nbsp; A girl living
in one of these houses is always close to soldiers.&nbsp; By looking
out of window she can always see soldiers; and sometimes a soldier will
nod to her or even call up to her.&nbsp; They never dream of asking
for wages.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll work eighteen hours a day, and put up
with anything just to be allowed to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. B.&rdquo; profited by this information, and engaged the
girl who offered the five pounds premium.&nbsp; She found her a perfect
treasure of a servant.&nbsp; She was invariably willing and respectful,
slept on a sofa in the kitchen, and was always contented with an egg
for her dinner.</p>
<p>The truth of this story I cannot vouch for.&nbsp; Myself, I can believe
it.&nbsp; Brown and MacShaughnassy made no attempt to do so, which seemed
unfriendly.&nbsp; Jephson excused himself on the plea of a headache.&nbsp;
I admit there are points in it presenting difficulties to the average
intellect.&nbsp; As I explained at the commencement, it was told to
me by Ethelbertha, who had it from Amenda, who got it from the char-woman,
and exaggerations may have crept into it.&nbsp; The following, however,
were incidents that came under my own personal observation.&nbsp; They
afforded a still stronger example of the influence exercised by Tommy
Atkins upon the British domestic, and I therefore thought it right to
relate them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heroine of them,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is our Amenda.&nbsp;
Now, you would call her a tolerably well-behaved, orderly young woman,
would you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my ideal of unostentatious respectability,&rdquo; answered
MacShaughnassy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my opinion also,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can, therefore, imagine my feelings on passing her one evening in the
Folkestone High Street with a Panama hat upon her head (<i>my</i> Panama
hat), and a soldier&rsquo;s arm round her waist.&nbsp; She was one of
a mob following the band of the Third Berkshire Infantry, then in camp
at Sandgate.&nbsp; There was an ecstatic, far-away look in her eyes.&nbsp;
She was dancing rather than walking, and with her left hand she beat
time to the music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbertha was with me at the time.&nbsp; We stared after
the procession until it had turned the corner, and then we stared at
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s impossible,&rsquo; said Ethelbertha
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But that was my hat,&rsquo; I said to Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment we reached home Ethelbertha looked for Amenda,
and I looked for my hat.&nbsp; Neither was to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock struck, ten o&rsquo;clock struck.&nbsp;
At half-past ten, we went down and got our own supper, and had it in
the kitchen.&nbsp; At a quarter-past eleven, Amenda returned.&nbsp;
She walked into the kitchen without a word, hung my hat up behind the
door, and commenced clearing away the supper things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbertha rose, calm but severe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been, Amenda?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gadding half over the county with a lot of low soldiers,&rsquo;
answered Amenda, continuing her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had on my hat,&rsquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Amenda, still continuing her
work, &lsquo;it was the first thing that came to hand.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;m
thankful for is that it wasn&rsquo;t missis&rsquo;s best bonnet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether Ethelbertha was mollified by the proper spirit displayed
in this last remark, I cannot say, but I think it probable.&nbsp; At
all events, it was in a voice more of sorrow than of anger that she
resumed her examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were walking with a soldier&rsquo;s arm around
your waist when we passed you, Amenda?&rsquo; she observed interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know, mum,&rsquo; admitted Amenda, &lsquo;I found
it there myself when the music stopped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbertha looked her inquiries.&nbsp; Amenda filled a saucepan
with water, and then replied to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a disgrace to a decent household,&rsquo;
she said; &lsquo;no mistress who respected herself would keep me a moment.&nbsp;
I ought to be put on the doorstep with my box and a month&rsquo;s wages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why did you do it then?&rsquo; said Ethelbertha,
with natural astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m a helpless ninny, mum.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
help myself; if I see soldiers I&rsquo;m bound to follow them.&nbsp;
It runs in our family.&nbsp; My poor cousin Emma was just such another
fool.&nbsp; She was engaged to be married to a quiet, respectable young
fellow with a shop of his own, and three days before the wedding she
ran off with a regiment of marines to Chatham and married the colour-sergeant.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I shall end by doing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been all the
way to Sandgate with that lot you saw me with, and I&rsquo;ve kissed
four of them&mdash;the nasty wretches.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a nice sort of
girl to be walking out with a respectable milkman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was so deeply disgusted with herself that it seemed superfluous
for anybody else to be indignant with her; and Ethelbertha changed her
tone and tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get over all that nonsense, Amenda,&rsquo;
she said, laughingly; &lsquo;you see yourself how silly it is.&nbsp;
You must tell Mr. Bowles to keep you away from soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, I can&rsquo;t look at it in the same light way
that you do, mum,&rsquo; returned Amenda, somewhat reprovingly; &lsquo;a
girl that can&rsquo;t see a bit of red marching down the street without
wanting to rush out and follow it ain&rsquo;t fit to be anybody&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; Why, I should be leaving the shop with nobody in it about
twice a week, and he&rsquo;d have to go the round of all the barracks
in London, looking for me.&nbsp; I shall save up and get myself into
a lunatic asylum, that&rsquo;s what I shall do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbertha began to grow quite troubled.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
surely this is something altogether new, Amenda,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;you
must have often met soldiers when you&rsquo;ve been out in London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes, one or two at a time, walking about anyhow,
I can stand that all right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s when there&rsquo;s a lot
of them with a band that I lose my head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like, mum,&rsquo;
she added, noticing Ethelbertha&rsquo;s puzzled expression; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve
never had it.&nbsp; I only hope you never may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kept a careful watch over Amenda during the remainder of
our stay at Folkestone, and an anxious time we had of it.&nbsp; Every
day some regiment or other would march through the town, and at the
first sound of its music Amenda would become restless and excited.&nbsp;
The Pied Piper&rsquo;s reed could not have stirred the Hamelin children
deeper than did those Sandgate bands the heart of our domestic.&nbsp;
Fortunately, they generally passed early in the morning when we were
indoors, but one day, returning home to lunch, we heard distant strains
dying away upon the Hythe Road.&nbsp; We hurried in.&nbsp; Ethelbertha
ran down into the kitchen; it was empty!&mdash;up into Amenda&rsquo;s
bedroom; it was vacant!&nbsp; We called.&nbsp; There was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That miserable girl has gone off again,&rsquo; said
Ethelbertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a terrible misfortune it is for her.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s quite a disease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbertha wanted me to go to Sandgate camp and inquire for
her.&nbsp; I was sorry for the girl myself, but the picture of a young
and innocent-looking man wandering about a complicated camp, inquiring
for a lost domestic, presenting itself to my mind, I said that I&rsquo;d
rather not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethelbertha thought me heartless, and said that if I would
not go she would go herself.&nbsp; I replied that I thought one female
member of my household was enough in that camp at a time, and requested
her not to.&nbsp; Ethelbertha expressed her sense of my inhuman behaviour
by haughtily declining to eat any lunch, and I expressed my sense of
her unreasonableness by sweeping the whole meal into the grate, after
which Ethelbertha suddenly developed exuberant affection for the cat
(who didn&rsquo;t want anybody&rsquo;s love, but wanted to get under
the grate after the lunch), and I became supernaturally absorbed in
the day-before-yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the afternoon, strolling out into the garden, I heard the
faint cry of a female in distress.&nbsp; I listened attentively, and
the cry was repeated.&nbsp; I thought it sounded like Amenda&rsquo;s
voice, but where it came from I could not conceive.&nbsp; It drew nearer,
however, as I approached the bottom of the garden, and at last I located
it in a small wooden shed, used by the proprietor of the house as a
dark-room for developing photographs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door was locked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that you, Amenda?&rsquo;
I cried through the keyhole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; came back the muffled answer. &lsquo;Will
you please let me out? you&rsquo;ll find the key on the ground near
the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered it on the grass about a yard away, and released
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who locked you in?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did, sir,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;I locked myself
in, and pushed the key out under the door.&nbsp; I had to do it, or
I should have gone off with those beastly soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t inconvenienced you, sir,&rsquo;
she added, stepping out; &lsquo;I left the lunch all laid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Amenda&rsquo;s passion for soldiers was her one tribute to sentiment.&nbsp;
Towards all others of the male sex she maintained an attitude of callous
unsusceptibility, and her engagements with them (which were numerous)
were entered into or abandoned on grounds so sordid as to seriously
shock Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>When she came to us she was engaged to a pork butcher&mdash;with
a milkman in reserve.&nbsp; For Amenda&rsquo;s sake we dealt with the
man, but we never liked him, and we liked his pork still less.&nbsp;
When, therefore, Amenda announced to us that her engagement with him
was &ldquo;off,&rdquo; and intimated that her feelings would in no way
suffer by our going elsewhere for our bacon, we secretly rejoiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident you have done right, Amenda,&rdquo; said Ethelbertha;
&ldquo;you would never have been happy with that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mum, I don&rsquo;t think I ever should,&rdquo; replied
Amenda.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how any girl could as hadn&rsquo;t
the digestion of an ostrich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethelbertha looked puzzled.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what has digestion got
to do with it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty good deal, mum,&rdquo; answered Amenda, &ldquo;when
you&rsquo;re thinking of marrying a man as can&rsquo;t make a sausage
fit to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethelbertha, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
mean to say you&rsquo;re breaking off the match because you don&rsquo;t
like his sausages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s what it comes to,&rdquo; agreed
Amenda, unconcernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an awful idea!&rdquo; sighed poor Ethelbertha, after
a long pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think you ever really loved him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Amenda, &ldquo;I loved him right enough,
but it&rsquo;s no good loving a man that wants you to live on sausages
that keep you awake all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does he want you to live on sausages?&rdquo; persisted
Ethelbertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t say anything about it,&rdquo; explained
Amenda; &ldquo;but you know what it is, mum, when you marry a pork butcher;
you&rsquo;re expected to eat what&rsquo;s left over.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the mistake my poor cousin Eliza made.&nbsp; She married a muffin man.&nbsp;
Of course, what he didn&rsquo;t sell they had to finish up themselves.&nbsp;
Why, one winter, when he had a run of bad luck, they lived for two months
on nothing but muffins.&nbsp; I never saw a girl so changed in all my
life.&nbsp; One has to think of these things, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the most shamefully mercenary engagement that I think Amenda
ever entered into, was one with a &rsquo;bus conductor.&nbsp; We were
living in the north of London then, and she had a young man, a cheesemonger,
who kept a shop in Lupus Street, Chelsea.&nbsp; He could not come up
to her because of the shop, so once a week she used to go down to him.&nbsp;
One did not ride ten miles for a penny in those days, and she found
the fare from Holloway to Victoria and back a severe tax upon her purse.&nbsp;
The same &rsquo;bus that took her down at six brought her back at ten.&nbsp;
During the first journey the &rsquo;bus conductor stared at Amenda;
during the second he talked to her, during the third he gave her a cocoanut,
during the fourth he proposed to her, and was promptly accepted.&nbsp;
After that, Amenda was enabled to visit her cheesemonger without expense.</p>
<p>He was a quaint character himself, this &rsquo;bus conductor.&nbsp;
I often rode with him to Fleet Street.&nbsp; He knew me quite well (I
suppose Amenda must have pointed me out to him), and would always ask
me after her&mdash;aloud, before all the other passengers, which was
trying&mdash;and give me messages to take back to her.&nbsp; Where women
were concerned he had what is called &ldquo;a way&rdquo; with him, and
from the extent and variety of his female acquaintance, and the evident
tenderness with which the majority of them regarded him, I am inclined
to hope that Amenda&rsquo;s desertion of him (which happened contemporaneously
with her jilting of the cheesemonger) caused him less prolonged suffering
than might otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p>He was a man from whom I derived a good deal of amusement one way
and another.&nbsp; Thinking of him brings back to my mind a somewhat
odd incident.</p>
<p>One afternoon, I jumped upon his &rsquo;bus in the Seven Sisters
Road.&nbsp; An elderly Frenchman was the only other occupant of the
vehicle.&nbsp; &ldquo;You vil not forget me,&rdquo; the Frenchman was
saying as I entered, &ldquo;I desire Sharing Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget yer,&rdquo; answered the conductor, &ldquo;you
shall &rsquo;ave yer Sharing Cross.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make a fuss about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the third time &rsquo;ee&rsquo;s arst me not
to forget &rsquo;im,&rdquo; he remarked to me in a stentorian aside;
&ldquo;&rsquo;ee don&rsquo;t giv&rsquo; yer much chance of doin&rsquo;
it, does &rsquo;ee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the corner of the Holloway Road we drew up, and our conductor
began to shout after the manner of his species: &ldquo;Charing Cross&mdash;Charing
Cross&mdash;&rsquo;ere yer are&mdash;Come along, lady&mdash;Charing
Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Frenchman jumped up, and prepared to exit; the conductor
pushed him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this
ain&rsquo;t Charing Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman looked puzzled, but collapsed meekly.&nbsp; We picked
up a few passengers, and proceeded on our way.&nbsp; Half a mile up
the Liverpool Road a lady stood on the kerb regarding us as we passed
with that pathetic mingling of desire and distrust which is the average
woman&rsquo;s attitude towards conveyances of all kinds.&nbsp; Our conductor
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where d&rsquo;yer want to go to?&rdquo; he asked her severely&mdash;&ldquo;Strand&mdash;Charing
Cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman did not hear or did not understand the first part of
the speech, but he caught the words &ldquo;Charing Cross,&rdquo; and
bounced up and out on to the step.&nbsp; The conductor collared him
as he was getting off, and jerked him back savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carn&rsquo;t yer keep still a minute,&rdquo; he cried indignantly;
&ldquo;blessed if you don&rsquo;t want lookin&rsquo; after like a bloomin&rsquo;
kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vont to be put down at Sharing Cross,&rdquo; answered the
Frenchman, humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You vont to be put down at Sharing Cross,&rdquo; repeated
the other bitterly, as he led him back to his seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
put yer down in the middle of the road if I &rsquo;ave much more of
yer.&nbsp; You stop there till I come and sling yer out.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t
likely to let yer go much past yer Sharing Cross, I shall be too jolly
glad to get rid o&rsquo; yer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor Frenchman subsided, and we jolted on.&nbsp; At &ldquo;The
Angel&rdquo; we, of course, stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Charing Cross,&rdquo;
shouted the conductor, and up sprang the Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Gawd,&rdquo; said the conductor, taking him by the
shoulders and forcing him down into the corner seat, &ldquo;wot am I
to do?&nbsp; Carn&rsquo;t somebody sit on &rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held him firmly down until the &rsquo;bus started, and then released
him.&nbsp; At the top of Chancery Lane the same scene took place, and
the poor little Frenchman became exasperated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He keep saying Sharing Cross, Sharing Cross,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
turning to the other passengers; &ldquo;and it is <i>no</i> Sharing
Cross.&nbsp; He is fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carn&rsquo;t yer understand,&rdquo; retorted the conductor,
equally indignant; &ldquo;of course I say Sharing Cross&mdash;I mean
Charing Cross, but that don&rsquo;t mean that it <i>is</i> Charing Cross.&nbsp;
That means&mdash;&rdquo; and then perceiving from the blank look on
the Frenchman&rsquo;s face the utter impossibility of ever making the
matter clear to him, he turned to us with an appealing gesture, and
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does any gentleman know the French for &lsquo;bloomin&rsquo;
idiot&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A day or two afterwards, I happened to enter his omnibus again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;did you get your French friend
to Charing Cross all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ardly
believe it, but I &rsquo;ad a bit of a row with a policeman just before
I got to the corner, and it put &rsquo;im clean out o&rsquo; my &rsquo;ead.&nbsp;
Blessed if I didn&rsquo;t run &rsquo;im on to Victoria.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Said Brown one evening, &ldquo;There is but one vice, and that is
selfishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jephson was standing before the fire lighting his pipe.&nbsp; He
puffed the tobacco into a glow, threw the match into the embers, and
then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the seed of all virtue also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and get on with your work,&rdquo; said MacShaughnassy
from the sofa where he lay at full length with his heels on a chair;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re discussing the novel.&nbsp; Paradoxes not admitted
during business hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jephson, however, was in an argumentative mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfishness,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is merely another
name for Will.&nbsp; Every deed, good or bad, that we do is prompted
by selfishness.&nbsp; We are charitable to secure ourselves a good place
in the next world, to make ourselves respected in this, to ease our
own distress at the knowledge of suffering.&nbsp; One man is kind because
it gives him pleasure to be kind, just as another is cruel because cruelty
pleases him.&nbsp; A great man does his duty because to him the sense
of duty done is a deeper delight than would be the case resulting from
avoidance of duty.&nbsp; The religious man is religious because he finds
a joy in religion; the moral man moral because with his strong self-respect,
viciousness would mean wretchedness.&nbsp; Self-sacrifice itself is
only a subtle selfishness: we prefer the mental exaltation gained thereby
to the sensual gratification which is the alternative reward.&nbsp;
Man cannot be anything else but selfish.&nbsp; Selfishness is the law
of all life.&nbsp; Each thing, from the farthest fixed star to the smallest
insect crawling on the earth, fighting for itself according to its strength;
and brooding over all, the Eternal, working for <i>Himself</i>: that
is the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some whisky,&rdquo; said MacShaughnassy; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
be so complicatedly metaphysical.&nbsp; You make my head ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all action, good and bad, spring from selfishness,&rdquo;
replied Brown, &ldquo;then there must be good selfishness and bad selfishness:
and your bad selfishness is my plain selfishness, without any adjective,
so we are back where we started.&nbsp; I say selfishness&mdash;bad selfishness&mdash;is
the root of all evil, and there you are bound to agree with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; persisted Jephson; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known
selfishness&mdash;selfishness according to the ordinarily accepted meaning
of the term&mdash;to be productive of good actions.&nbsp; I can give
you an instance, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it got a moral?&rdquo; asked MacShaughnassy, drowsily,</p>
<p>Jephson mused a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said at length;
&ldquo;a very practical moral&mdash;and one very useful to young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of story we want,&rdquo; said the MacShaughnassy,
raising himself into a sitting position.&nbsp; &ldquo;You listen to
this, Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jephson seated himself upon a chair, in his favourite attitude, with
his elbows resting upon the back, and smoked for a while in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three people in this story,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;the
wife, the wife&rsquo;s husband, and the other man.&nbsp; In most dramas
of this type, it is the wife who is the chief character.&nbsp; In this
case, the interesting person is the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wife&mdash;I met her once: she was the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen, and the most wicked-looking; which is saying
a good deal for both statements.&nbsp; I remember, during a walking
tour one year, coming across a lovely little cottage.&nbsp; It was the
sweetest place imaginable.&nbsp; I need not describe it.&nbsp; It was
the cottage one sees in pictures, and reads of in sentimental poetry.&nbsp;
I was leaning over the neatly-cropped hedge, drinking in its beauty,
when at one of the tiny casements I saw, looking out at me, a face.&nbsp;
It stayed there only a moment, but in that moment the cottage had become
ugly, and I hurried away with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman&rsquo;s face reminded me of the incident.&nbsp;
It was an angel&rsquo;s face, until the woman herself looked out of
it: then you were struck by the strange incongruity between tenement
and tenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That at one time she had loved her husband, I have little
doubt.&nbsp; Vicious women have few vices, and sordidness is not usually
one of them.&nbsp; She had probably married him, borne towards him by
one of those waves of passion upon which the souls of animal natures
are continually rising and falling.&nbsp; On possession, however, had
quickly followed satiety, and from satiety had grown the desire for
a new sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were living at Cairo at the period; her husband held
an important official position there, and by virtue of this, and of
her own beauty and tact, her house soon became the centre of the Anglo-Saxon
society ever drifting in and out of the city.&nbsp; The women disliked
her, and copied her.&nbsp; The men spoke slightingly of her to their
wives, lightly of her to each other, and made idiots of themselves when
they were alone with her.&nbsp; She laughed at them to their faces,
and mimicked them behind their backs.&nbsp; Their friends said it was
clever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One year there arrived a young English engineer, who had come
out to superintend some canal works.&nbsp; He brought with him satisfactory
letters of recommendation, and was at once received by the European
residents as a welcome addition to their social circle.&nbsp; He was
not particularly good-looking, he was not remarkably charming, but he
possessed the one thing that few women can resist in a man, and that
is strength.&nbsp; The woman looked at the man, and the man looked back
at the woman; and the drama began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scandal flies swiftly through small communities.&nbsp; Before
a month, their relationship was the chief topic of conversation throughout
the quarter.&nbsp; In less than two, it reached the ears of the woman&rsquo;s
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was either an exceptionally mean or an exceptionally noble
character, according to how one views the matter.&nbsp; He worshipped
his wife&mdash;as men with big hearts and weak brains often do worship
such women&mdash;with dog-like devotion.&nbsp; His only dread was lest
the scandal should reach proportions that would compel him to take notice
of it, and thus bring shame and suffering upon the woman to whom he
would have given his life.&nbsp; That a man who saw her should love
her seemed natural to him; that she should have grown tired of himself,
a thing not to be wondered at.&nbsp; He was grateful to her for having
once loved him, for a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for &lsquo;the other man,&rsquo; he proved somewhat of
an enigma to the gossips.&nbsp; He attempted no secrecy; if anything,
he rather paraded his subjugation&mdash;or his conquest, it was difficult
to decide which term to apply.&nbsp; He rode and drove with her; visited
her in public and in private (in such privacy as can be hoped for in
a house filled with chattering servants, and watched by spying eyes);
loaded her with expensive presents, which she wore openly, and papered
his smoking-den with her photographs.&nbsp; Yet he never allowed himself
to appear in the least degree ridiculous; never allowed her to come
between him and his work.&nbsp; A letter from her, he would lay aside
unopened until he had finished what he evidently regarded as more important
business.&nbsp; When boudoir and engine-shed became rivals, it was the
boudoir that had to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman chafed under his self-control, which stung her like
a lash, but clung to him the more abjectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me you love me!&rsquo; she would cry fiercely,
stretching her white arms towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have told you so,&rsquo; he would reply calmly, without
moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to hear you tell it me again,&rsquo; she would
plead with a voice that trembled on a sob.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come close to
me and tell it me again, again, again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as she lay with half-closed eyes, he would pour forth
a flood of passionate words sufficient to satisfy even her thirsty ears,
and afterwards, as the gates clanged behind him, would take up an engineering
problem at the exact point at which half an hour before, on her entrance
into the room, he had temporarily dismissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, a privileged friend put bluntly to him this question:
&lsquo;Are you playing for love or vanity?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which the man, after long pondering, gave this reply: &lsquo;&rsquo;Pon
my soul, Jack, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when a man is in love with a woman who cannot make up
her mind whether she loves him or not, we call the complication comedy;
where it is the woman who is in earnest the result is generally tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They continued to meet and to make love.&nbsp; They talked&mdash;as
people in their position are prone to talk&mdash;of the beautiful life
they would lead if it only were not for the thing that was; of the earthly
paradise&mdash;or, maybe, &lsquo;earthy&rsquo; would be the more suitable
adjective&mdash;they would each create for the other, if only they had
the right which they hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this work of imagination the man trusted chiefly to his
literary faculties, which were considerable; the woman to her desires.&nbsp;
Thus, his scenes possessed a grace and finish which hers lacked, but
her pictures were the more vivid.&nbsp; Indeed, so realistic did she
paint them, that to herself they seemed realities, waiting for her.&nbsp;
Then she would rise to go towards them only to strike herself against
the thought of the thing that stood between her and them.&nbsp; At first
she only hated the thing, but after a while there came an ugly look
of hope into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time drew near for the man to return to England.&nbsp;
The canal was completed, and a day appointed for the letting in of the
water.&nbsp; The man determined to make the event the occasion of a
social gathering.&nbsp; He invited a large number of guests, among whom
were the woman and her husband, to assist at the function.&nbsp; Afterwards
the party were to picnic at a pleasant wooded spot some three-quarters
of a mile from the first lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ceremony of flooding was to be performed by the woman,
her husband&rsquo;s position entitling her to this distinction.&nbsp;
Between the river and the head of the cutting had been left a strong
bank of earth, pierced some distance down by a hole, which hole was
kept closed by means of a closely-fitting steel plate.&nbsp; The woman
drew the lever releasing this plate, and the water rushed through and
began to press against the lock gates.&nbsp; When it had attained a
certain depth, the sluices were raised, and the water poured down into
the deep basin of the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an exceptionally deep lock.&nbsp; The party gathered
round and watched the water slowly rising.&nbsp; The woman looked down,
and shuddered; the man was standing by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How deep it is,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;it holds thirty feet
of water, when full.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water crept up inch by inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you open the gates, and let it in quickly?&rsquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It would not do for it to come in too quickly,&rsquo;
he explained; &lsquo;we shall half fill this lock, and then open the
sluices at the other end, and so let the water pass through.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman looked at the smooth stone walls and at the iron-plated
gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder what a man would do,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if
he fell in, and there was no one near to help him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think he would stop there,&rsquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, the others are waiting for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lingered a moment to give some final instructions to the
workmen.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can follow on when you&rsquo;ve made all right,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;and get something to eat.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no need
for more than one to stop.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they joined the rest of
the party, and sauntered on, laughing and talking, to the picnic ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After lunch the party broke up, as is the custom of picnic
parties, and wandered away in groups and pairs.&nbsp; The man, whose
duty as host had hitherto occupied all his attention, looked for the
woman, but she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend strolled by, the same that had put the question to
him about love and vanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you quarrelled?&rsquo; asked the friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I fancied you had,&rsquo; said the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
met her just now walking with her husband, of all men in the world,
and making herself quite agreeable to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The friend strolled on, and the man sat down on a fallen tree,
and lighted a cigar.&nbsp; He smoked and thought, and the cigar burnt
out, but he still sat thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a while he heard a faint rustling of the branches behind
him, and peering between the interlacing leaves that hid him, saw the
crouching figure of the woman creeping through the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His lips were parted to call her name, when she turned her
listening head in his direction, and his eyes fell full upon her face.&nbsp;
Something about it, he could not have told what, struck him dumb, and
the woman crept on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gradually the nebulous thoughts floating through his brain
began to solidify into a tangible idea, and the man unconsciously started
forward.&nbsp; After walking a few steps he broke into a run, for the
idea had grown clearer.&nbsp; It continued to grow still clearer and
clearer, and the man ran faster and faster, until at last he found himself
racing madly towards the lock.&nbsp; As he approached it he looked round
for the watchman who ought to have been there, but the man was gone
from his post.&nbsp; He shouted, but if any answer was returned, it
was drowned by the roar of the rushing water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He reached the edge and looked down.&nbsp; Fifteen feet below
him was the reality of the dim vision that had come to him a mile back
in the woods: the woman&rsquo;s husband swimming round and round like
a rat in a pail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river was flowing in and out of the lock at the same rate,
so that the level of the water remained constant.&nbsp; The first thing
the man did was to close the lower sluices and then open those in the
upper gate to their fullest extent.&nbsp; The water began to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you hold out?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drowning man turned to him a face already contorted by
the agony of exhaustion, and answered with a feeble &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked around for something to throw to the man.&nbsp;
A plank had lain there in the morning, he remembered stumbling over
it, and complaining of its having been left there; he cursed himself
now for his care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hut used by the navvies to keep their tools in stood about
two hundred yards away; perhaps it had been taken there, perhaps there
he might even find a rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just one minute, old fellow!&rsquo; he shouted down,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll be back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the other did not hear him.&nbsp; The feeble struggles
ceased.&nbsp; The face fell back upon the water, the eyes half closed
as if with weary indifference.&nbsp; There was no time for him to do
more than kick off his riding boots and jump in and clutch the unconscious
figure as it sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down there, in that walled-in trap, he fought a long fight
with Death for the life that stood between him and the woman.&nbsp;
He was not an expert swimmer, his clothes hampered him, he was already
blown with his long race, the burden in his arms dragged him down, the
water rose slowly enough to make his torture fit for Dante&rsquo;s hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first he could not understand why this was so, but in glancing
down he saw to his horror that he had not properly closed the lower
sluices; in each some eight or ten inches remained open, so that the
stream was passing out nearly half as fast as it came in.&nbsp; It would
be another five-and-twenty minutes before the water would be high enough
for him to grasp the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He noted where the line of wet had reached to, on the smooth
stone wall, then looked again after what he thought must be a lapse
of ten minutes, and found it had risen half an inch, if that.&nbsp;
Once or twice he shouted for help, but the effort taxed severely his
already failing breath, and his voice only came back to him in a hundred
echoes from his prison walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inch by inch the line of wet crept up, but the spending of
his strength went on more swiftly.&nbsp; It seemed to him as if his
inside were being gripped and torn slowly out: his whole body cried
out to him to let it sink and lie in rest at the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length his unconscious burden opened its eyes and stared
at him stupidly, then closed them again with a sigh; a minute later
opened them once more, and looked long and hard at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me go,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we shall both drown.&nbsp;
You can manage by yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a feeble effort to release himself, but the other
held him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep still, you fool!&rsquo; he hissed; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
going to get out of this with me, or I&rsquo;m going down with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the grim struggle went on in silence, till the man, looking
up, saw the stone coping just a little way above his head, made one
mad leap and caught it with his finger-tips, held on an instant, then
fell back with a &lsquo;plump&rsquo; and sank; came up and made another
dash, and, helped by the impetus of his rise, caught the coping firmly
this time with the whole of his fingers, hung on till his eyes saw the
stunted grass, till they were both able to scramble out upon the bank
and lie there, their breasts pressed close against the ground, their
hands clutching the earth, while the overflowing water swirled softly
round them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a while, they raised themselves and looked at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tiring work,&rsquo; said the other man, with a nod
towards the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered the husband, &lsquo;beastly awkward
not being a good swimmer.&nbsp; How did you know I had fallen in?&nbsp;
You met my wife, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The husband sat staring at a point in the horizon for some
minutes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know what I was wondering this morning?&rsquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether I should kill you or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They told me,&rsquo; he continued, after a pause, &lsquo;a
lot of silly gossip which I was cad enough to believe.&nbsp; I know
now it wasn&rsquo;t true, because&mdash;well, if it had been, you would
not have done what you have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose and came across.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo;
he said, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg yours,&rsquo; said the other man, rising and
taking it; &lsquo;do you mind giving me a hand with the sluices?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They set to work to put the lock right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How did you manage to fall in?&rsquo; asked the other
man, who was raising one of the lower sluices, without looking round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The husband hesitated, as if he found the explanation somewhat
difficult.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he answered carelessly, &lsquo;the
wife and I were chaffing, and she said she&rsquo;d often seen you jump
it, and&rsquo;&mdash;he laughed a rather forced laugh&mdash;&lsquo;she
promised me a&mdash;a kiss if I cleared it.&nbsp; It was a foolish thing
to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it was rather,&rsquo; said the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days afterwards the man and woman met at a reception.&nbsp;
He found her in a leafy corner of the garden talking to some friends.&nbsp;
She advanced to meet him, holding out her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can
I say more than thank you?&rsquo; she murmured in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others moved away, leaving them alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
tell me you risked your life to save his?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She raised her eyes to his, then struck him across the face
with her ungloved hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You damned fool!&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seized her by her white arms, and forced her back behind
the orange trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know why?&rsquo; he said, speaking
slowly and distinctly; &lsquo;because I feared that, with him dead,
you would want me to marry you, and that, talked about as we have been,
I might find it awkward to avoid doing so; because I feared that, without
him to stand between us, you might prove an annoyance to me&mdash;perhaps
come between me and the woman I love, the woman I am going back to.&nbsp;
Now do you understand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; whispered the woman, and he left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are only two people,&rdquo; concluded Jephson, &ldquo;who
do not regard his saving of the husband&rsquo;s life as a highly noble
and unselfish action, and they are the man himself and the woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thanked Jephson for his story, and promised to profit by the moral,
when discovered.&nbsp; Meanwhile, MacShaughnassy said that he knew a
story dealing with the same theme, namely, the too close attachment
of a woman to a strange man, which really had a moral, which moral was:
don&rsquo;t have anything to do with inventions.</p>
<p>Brown, who had patented a safety gun, which he had never yet found
a man plucky enough to let off, said it was a bad moral.&nbsp; We agreed
to hear the particulars, and judge for ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This story,&rdquo; commenced MacShaughnassy, &ldquo;comes
from Furtwangen, a small town in the Black Forest.&nbsp; There lived
there a very wonderful old fellow named Nicholaus Geibel.&nbsp; His
business was the making of mechanical toys, at which work he had acquired
an almost European reputation.&nbsp; He made rabbits that would emerge
from the heart of a cabbage, flap their ears, smooth their whiskers,
and disappear again; cats that would wash their faces, and mew so naturally
that dogs would mistake them for real cats, and fly at them; dolls,
with phonographs concealed within them, that would raise their hats
and say, &lsquo;Good morning; how do you do?&rsquo; and some that would
even sing a song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was something more than a mere mechanic; he was an
artist.&nbsp; His work was with him a hobby, almost a passion.&nbsp;
His shop was filled with all manner of strange things that never would,
or could, be sold&mdash;things he had made for the pure love of making
them.&nbsp; He had contrived a mechanical donkey that would trot for
two hours by means of stored electricity, and trot, too, much faster
than the live article, and with less need for exertion on the part of
the driver; a bird that would shoot up into the air, fly round and round
in a circle, and drop to earth at the exact spot from where it started;
a skeleton that, supported by an upright iron bar, would dance a hornpipe;
a life-size lady doll that could play the fiddle; and a gentleman with
a hollow inside who could smoke a pipe and drink more lager beer than
any three average German students put together, which is saying much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it was the belief of the town that old Geibel could
make a man capable of doing everything that a respectable man need want
to do.&nbsp; One day he made a man who did too much, and it came about
in this way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Doctor Follen had a baby, and the baby had a birthday.&nbsp;
Its first birthday put Doctor Follen&rsquo;s household into somewhat
of a flurry, but on the occasion of its second birthday, Mrs. Doctor
Follen gave a ball in honour of the event.&nbsp; Old Geibel and his
daughter Olga were among the guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the afternoon of the next day, some three or four of
Olga&rsquo;s bosom friends, who had also been present at the ball, dropped
in to have a chat about it.&nbsp; They naturally fell to discussing
the men, and to criticising their dancing.&nbsp; Old Geibel was in the
room, but he appeared to be absorbed in his newspaper, and the girls
took no notice of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There seem to be fewer men who can dance, at every
ball you go to,&rsquo; said one of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, and don&rsquo;t the ones who can, give themselves
airs,&rsquo; said another; &lsquo;they make quite a favour of asking
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how stupidly they talk,&rsquo; added a third.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They always say exactly the same things: &ldquo;How charming
you are looking to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you often go to Vienna?&nbsp;
Oh, you should, it&rsquo;s delightful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a charming
dress you have on.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a warm day it has been.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you like Wagner?&rdquo;&nbsp; I do wish they&rsquo;d think
of something new.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I never mind how they talk,&rsquo; said a fourth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If a man dances well he may be a fool for all I care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He generally is,&rsquo; slipped in a thin girl, rather
spitefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I go to a ball to dance,&rsquo; continued the previous
speaker, not noticing the interruption.&nbsp; &lsquo;All I ask of a
partner is that he shall hold me firmly, take me round steadily, and
not get tired before I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A clockwork figure would be the thing for you,&rsquo;
said the girl who had interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; cried one of the others, clapping her
hands, &lsquo;what a capital idea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a capital idea?&rsquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, a clockwork dancer, or, better still, one that
would go by electricity and never run down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girls took up the idea with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, what a lovely partner he would make,&rsquo; said
one; &lsquo;he would never kick you, or tread on your toes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or tear your dress,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or get out of step.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or get giddy and lean on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And he would never want to mop his face with his handkerchief.&nbsp;
I do hate to see a man do that after every dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend the whole evening
in the supper-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, with a phonograph inside him to grind out all
the stock remarks, you would not be able to tell him from a real man,&rsquo;
said the girl who had first suggested the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes, you would,&rsquo; said the thin girl, &lsquo;he
would be so much nicer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Geibel had laid down his paper, and was listening with
both his ears.&nbsp; On one of the girls glancing in his direction,
however, he hurriedly hid himself again behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the girls were gone, he went into his workshop, where
Olga heard him walking up and down, and every now and then chuckling
to himself; and that night he talked to her a good deal about dancing
and dancing men&mdash;asked what they usually said and did&mdash;what
dances were most popular&mdash;what steps were gone through, with many
other questions bearing on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for a couple of weeks he kept much to his factory, and
was very thoughtful and busy, though prone at unexpected moments to
break into a quiet low laugh, as if enjoying a joke that nobody else
knew of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month later another ball took place in Furtwangen.&nbsp;
On this occasion it was given by old Wenzel, the wealthy timber merchant,
to celebrate his niece&rsquo;s betrothal, and Geibel and his daughter
were again among the invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the hour arrived to set out, Olga sought her father.&nbsp;
Not finding him in the house, she tapped at the door of his workshop.&nbsp;
He appeared in his shirt-sleeves, looking hot, but radiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you
go on, I&rsquo;ll follow you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got something to finish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she turned to obey he called after her, &lsquo;Tell them
I&rsquo;m going to bring a young man with me&mdash;such a nice young
man, and an excellent dancer.&nbsp; All the girls will like him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then he laughed and closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father generally kept his doings secret from everybody,
but she had a pretty shrewd suspicion of what he had been planning,
and so, to a certain extent, was able to prepare the guests for what
was coming.&nbsp; Anticipation ran high, and the arrival of the famous
mechanist was eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length the sound of wheels was heard outside, followed
by a great commotion in the passage, and old Wenzel himself, his jolly
face red with excitement and suppressed laughter, burst into the room
and announced in stentorian tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Herr Geibel&mdash;and a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Geibel and his &lsquo;friend&rsquo; entered, greeted
with shouts of laughter and applause, and advanced to the centre of
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Allow me, ladies and gentlemen,&rsquo; said Herr Geibel,
&lsquo;to introduce you to my friend, Lieutenant Fritz.&nbsp; Fritz,
my dear fellow, bow to the ladies and gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geibel placed his hand encouragingly on Fritz&rsquo;s shoulder,
and the lieutenant bowed low, accompanying the action with a harsh clicking
noise in his throat, unpleasantly suggestive of a death rattle.&nbsp;
But that was only a detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He walks a little stiffly&rsquo; (old Geibel took his
arm and walked him forward a few steps.&nbsp; He certainly did walk
stiffly), &lsquo;but then, walking is not his forte.&nbsp; He is essentially
a dancing man.&nbsp; I have only been able to teach him the waltz as
yet, but at that he is faultless.&nbsp; Come, which of you ladies may
I introduce him to, as a partner?&nbsp; He keeps perfect time; he never
gets tired; he won&rsquo;t kick you or tread on your dress; he will
hold you as firmly as you like, and go as quickly or as slowly as you
please; he never gets giddy; and he is full of conversation.&nbsp; Come,
speak up for yourself, my boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gentleman twisted one of the buttons of his coat,
and immediately Fritz opened his mouth, and in thin tones that appeared
to proceed from the back of his head, remarked suddenly, &lsquo;May
I have the pleasure?&rsquo; and then shut his mouth again with a snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Lieutenant Fritz had made a strong impression on the
company was undoubted, yet none of the girls seemed inclined to dance
with him.&nbsp; They looked askance at his waxen face, with its staring
eyes and fixed smile, and shuddered.&nbsp; At last old Geibel came to
the girl who had conceived the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is your own suggestion, carried out to the letter,&rsquo;
said Geibel, &lsquo;an electric dancer.&nbsp; You owe it to the gentleman
to give him a trial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a bright saucy little girl, fond of a frolic.&nbsp;
Her host added his entreaties, and she consented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Geibel fixed the figure to her.&nbsp; Its right arm was
screwed round her waist, and held her firmly; its delicately jointed
left hand was made to fasten itself upon her right.&nbsp; The old toymaker
showed her how to regulate its speed, and how to stop it, and release
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It will take you round in a complete circle,&rsquo;
he explained; &lsquo;be careful that no one knocks against you, and
alters its course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music struck up.&nbsp; Old Geibel put the current in motion,
and Annette and her strange partner began to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a while every one stood watching them.&nbsp; The figure
performed its purpose admirably.&nbsp; Keeping perfect time and step,
and holding its little partner tightly clasped in an unyielding embrace,
it revolved steadily, pouring forth at the same time a constant flow
of squeaky conversation, broken by brief intervals of grinding silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How charming you are looking to-night,&rsquo; it remarked
in its thin, far-away voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a lovely day it has been.&nbsp;
Do you like dancing?&nbsp; How well our steps agree.&nbsp; You will
give me another, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t be so cruel.&nbsp;
What a charming gown you have on.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t waltzing delightful?&nbsp;
I could go on dancing for ever&mdash;with you.&nbsp; Have you had supper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she grew more familiar with the uncanny creature, the girl&rsquo;s
nervousness wore off, and she entered into the fun of the thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s just lovely,&rsquo; she cried, laughing,
&lsquo;I could go on dancing with him all my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couple after couple now joined them, and soon all the dancers
in the room were whirling round behind them.&nbsp; Nicholaus Geibel
stood looking on, beaming with childish delight at his success,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Wenzel approached him, and whispered something in his
ear.&nbsp; Geibel laughed and nodded, and the two worked their way quietly
towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the young people&rsquo;s house to-night,&rsquo;
said Wenzel, as soon as they were outside; &lsquo;you and I will have
a quiet pipe and a glass of hock, over in the counting-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the dancing grew more fast and furious.&nbsp; Little
Annette loosened the screw regulating her partner&rsquo;s rate of progress,
and the figure flew round with her swifter and swifter.&nbsp; Couple
after couple dropped out exhausted, but they only went the faster, till
at length they were the only pair left dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madder and madder became the waltz.&nbsp; The music lagged
behind: the musicians, unable to keep pace, ceased, and sat staring.&nbsp;
The younger guests applauded, but the older faces began to grow anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better stop, dear,&rsquo; said one
of the women, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make yourself so tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Annette did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe she&rsquo;s fainted,&rsquo; cried out a girl,
who had caught sight of her face as it was swept by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the men sprang forward and clutched at the figure,
but its impetus threw him down on to the floor, where its steel-cased
feet laid bare his cheek.&nbsp; The thing evidently did not intend to
part with its prize easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had any one retained a cool head, the figure, one cannot help
thinking, might easily have been stopped.&nbsp; Two or three men, acting
in concert, might have lifted it bodily off the floor, or have jammed
it into a corner.&nbsp; But few human heads are capable of remaining
cool under excitement.&nbsp; Those who are not present think how stupid
must have been those who were; those who are, reflect afterwards how
simple it would have been to do this, that, or the other, if only they
had thought of it at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women grew hysterical.&nbsp; The men shouted contradictory
directions to one another.&nbsp; Two of them made a bungling rush at
the figure, which had the result of forcing it out of its orbit in the
centre of the room, and sending it crashing against the walls and furniture.&nbsp;
A stream of blood showed itself down the girl&rsquo;s white frock, and
followed her along the floor.&nbsp; The affair was becoming horrible.&nbsp;
The women rushed screaming from the room.&nbsp; The men followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One sensible suggestion was made: &lsquo;Find Geibel&mdash;fetch
Geibel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one had noticed him leave the room, no one knew where he
was.&nbsp; A party went in search of him.&nbsp; The others, too unnerved
to go back into the ballroom, crowded outside the door and listened.&nbsp;
They could hear the steady whir of the wheels upon the polished floor,
as the thing spun round and round; the dull thud as every now and again
it dashed itself and its burden against some opposing object and ricocheted
off in a new direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And everlastingly it talked in that thin ghostly voice, repeating
over and over the same formula: &lsquo;How charming you are looking
to-night.&nbsp; What a lovely day it has been.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t
be so cruel.&nbsp; I could go on dancing for ever&mdash;with you.&nbsp;
Have you had supper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they sought for Geibel everywhere but where he was.&nbsp;
They looked in every room in the house, then they rushed off in a body
to his own place, and spent precious minutes in waking up his deaf old
housekeeper.&nbsp; At last it occurred to one of the party that Wenzel
was missing also, and then the idea of the counting-house across the
yard presented itself to them, and there they found him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rose up, very pale, and followed them; and he and old Wenzel
forced their way through the crowd of guests gathered outside, and entered
the room, and locked the door behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From within there came the muffled sound of low voices and
quick steps, followed by a confused scuffling noise, then silence, then
the low voices again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a time the door opened, and those near it pressed forward
to enter, but old Wenzel&rsquo;s broad shoulders barred the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want you&mdash;and you, Bekler,&rsquo; he said, addressing
a couple of the elder men.&nbsp; His voice was calm, but his face was
deadly white.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rest of you, please go&mdash;get the
women away as quickly as you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that day old Nicholaus Geibel confined himself to the
making of mechanical rabbits and cats that mewed and washed their faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We agreed that the moral of MacShaughnassy&rsquo;s story was a good
one.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>How much more of our&mdash;fortunately not very valuable&mdash;time
we devoted to this wonderful novel of ours, I cannot exactly say.&nbsp;
Turning the dogs&rsquo;-eared leaves of the dilapidated diary that lies
before me, I find the record of our later gatherings confused and incomplete.&nbsp;
For weeks there does not appear a single word.&nbsp; Then comes an alarmingly
business-like minute of a meeting at which there were&mdash;&ldquo;Present:
Jephson, MacShaughnassy, Brown, and Self&rdquo;; and at which the &ldquo;Proceedings
commenced at 8.30.&rdquo;&nbsp; At what time the &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;
terminated, and what business was done, the chronicle, however, sayeth
not; though, faintly pencilled in the margin of the page, I trace these
hieroglyphics: &ldquo;3.14.9-2.6.7,&rdquo; bringing out a result of
&ldquo;1.8.2.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evidently an unremunerative night.</p>
<p>On September 13th we seem to have become suddenly imbued with energy
to a quite remarkable degree, for I read that we &ldquo;Resolved to
start the first chapter at once&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;at once&rdquo; being
underlined.&nbsp; After this spurt, we rest until October 4th, when
we &ldquo;Discussed whether it should be a novel of plot or of character,&rdquo;
without&mdash;so far as the diary affords indication&mdash;arriving
at any definite decision.&nbsp; I observe that on the same day &ldquo;Mac
told a story about a man who accidentally bought a camel at a sale.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Details of the story are, however, wanting, which, perhaps, is fortunate
for the reader.</p>
<p>On the 16th, we were still debating the character of our hero; and
I see that I suggested &ldquo;a man of the Charley Buswell type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Charley, I wonder what could have made me think of him in connection
with heroes; his lovableness, I suppose&mdash;certainly not his heroic
qualities.&nbsp; I can recall his boyish face now (it was always a boyish
face), the tears streaming down it as he sat in the schoolyard beside
a bucket, in which he was drowning three white mice and a tame rat.&nbsp;
I sat down opposite and cried too, while helping him to hold a saucepan
lid over the poor little creatures, and thus there sprang up a friendship
between us, which grew.</p>
<p>Over the grave of these murdered rodents, he took a solemn oath never
to break school rules again, by keeping either white mice or tame rats,
but to devote the whole of his energies for the future to pleasing his
masters, and affording his parents some satisfaction for the money being
spent upon his education.</p>
<p>Seven weeks later, the pervadence throughout the dormitory of an
atmospheric effect more curious than pleasing led to the discovery that
he had converted his box into a rabbit hutch.&nbsp; Confronted with
eleven kicking witnesses, and reminded of his former promises, he explained
that rabbits were not mice, and seemed to consider that a new and vexatious
regulation had been sprung upon him.&nbsp; The rabbits were confiscated.&nbsp;
What was their ultimate fate, we never knew with certainty, but three
days later we were given rabbit-pie for dinner.&nbsp; To comfort him
I endeavoured to assure him that these could not be his rabbits.&nbsp;
He, however, convinced that they were, cried steadily into his plate
all the time that he was eating them, and afterwards, in the playground,
had a stand-up fight with a fourth form boy who had requested a second
helping.</p>
<p>That evening he performed another solemn oath-taking, and for the
next month was the model boy of the school.&nbsp; He read tracts, sent
his spare pocket-money to assist in annoying the heathen, and subscribed
to <i>The Young Christian</i> and <i>The Weekly Rambler</i>, an Evangelical
Miscellany (whatever that may mean).&nbsp; An undiluted course of this
pernicious literature naturally created in him a desire towards the
opposite extreme.&nbsp; He suddenly dropped <i>The Young Christian</i>
and <i>The Weekly Rambler</i>, and purchased penny dreadfuls; and taking
no further interest in the welfare of the heathen, saved up and bought
a second-hand revolver and a hundred cartridges.&nbsp; His ambition,
he confided to me, was to become &ldquo;a dead shot,&rdquo; and the
marvel of it is that he did not succeed.</p>
<p>Of course, there followed the usual discovery and consequent trouble,
the usual repentance and reformation, the usual determination to start
a new life.</p>
<p>Poor fellow, he lived &ldquo;starting a new life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every
New Year&rsquo;s Day he would start a new life&mdash;on his birthday&mdash;on
other people&rsquo;s birthdays.&nbsp; I fancy that, later on, when he
came to know their importance, he extended the principle to quarter
days.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tidying up, and starting afresh,&rdquo; he always
called it.</p>
<p>I think as a young man he was better than most of us.&nbsp; But he
lacked that great gift which is the distinguishing feature of the English-speaking
race all the world over, the gift of hypocrisy.&nbsp; He seemed incapable
of doing the slightest thing without getting found out; a grave misfortune
for a man to suffer from, this.</p>
<p>Dear simple-hearted fellow, it never occurred to him that he was
as other men&mdash;with, perhaps, a dash of straightforwardness added;
he regarded himself as a monster of depravity.&nbsp; One evening I found
him in his chambers engaged upon his Sisyphean labour of &ldquo;tidying
up.&rdquo; A heap of letters, photographs, and bills lay before him.&nbsp;
He was tearing them up and throwing them into the fire.</p>
<p>I came towards him, but he stopped me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come
near me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not fit to shake hands with a decent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the sort of speech to make one feel hot and uncomfortable.&nbsp;
I did not know what to answer, and murmured something about his being
no worse than the average.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; he answered excitedly;
&ldquo;you say that to comfort me, I know; but I don&rsquo;t like to
hear it.&nbsp; If I thought other men were like me I should be ashamed
of being a man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a blackguard, old fellow, but,
please God, it&rsquo;s not too late.&nbsp; To-morrow morning I begin
a new life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He finished his work of destruction, and then rang the bell, and
sent his man downstairs for a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My last drink,&rdquo; he said, as we clicked glasses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the old life out, and the new life in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a sip and flung the glass with the remainder into the fire.&nbsp;
He was always a little theatrical, especially when most in earnest.</p>
<p>For a long while after that I saw nothing of him.&nbsp; Then, one
evening, sitting down to supper at a restaurant, I noticed him opposite
to me in company that could hardly be called doubtful.</p>
<p>He flushed and came over to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been an old
woman for nearly six months,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
find I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what is life for but
to live?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only hypocritical to try and be a thing we
are not.&nbsp; And do you know&rdquo;&mdash;he leant across the table,
speaking earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;honestly and seriously, I&rsquo;m a
better man&mdash;I feel it and know it&mdash;when I am my natural self
than when I am trying to be an impossible saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the mistake he made; he always ran to extremes.&nbsp; He
thought that an oath, if it were only big enough, would frighten away
Human Nature, instead of serving only as a challenge to it.&nbsp; Accordingly,
each reformation was more intemperate than the last, to be duly followed
by a greater swing of the pendulum in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Being now in a thoroughly reckless mood, he went the pace rather
hotly.&nbsp; Then, one evening, without any previous warning, I had
a note from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come round and see me on Thursday.&nbsp;
It is my wedding eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went.&nbsp; He was once more &ldquo;tidying up.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
his drawers were open, and on the table were piled packs of cards, betting
books, and much written paper, all, as before, in course of demolition.</p>
<p>I smiled: I could not help it, and, no way abashed, he laughed his
usual hearty, honest laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he exclaimed gaily, &ldquo;but this is not
the same as the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, laying his hand on my shoulder, and speaking with the sudden
seriousness that comes so readily to shallow natures, he said, &ldquo;God
has heard my prayer, old friend.&nbsp; He knows I am weak.&nbsp; He
has sent down an angel out of Heaven to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her portrait from the mantelpiece and handed it me.&nbsp;
It seemed to me the face of a hard, narrow woman, but, of course, he
raved about her.</p>
<p>As he talked, there fluttered to the ground from the heap before
him an old restaurant bill, and, stooping, he picked it up and held
it in his hand, musing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever noticed how the scent of the champagne and the
candles seems to cling to these things?&rdquo; he said lightly, sniffing
carelessly at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s become of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I wouldn&rsquo;t think about her at all to-night,&rdquo;
I answered.</p>
<p>He loosened his hand, letting the paper fall into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried vehemently, &ldquo;when I think of
all the wrong I have done&mdash;the irreparable, ever-widening ruin
I have perhaps brought into the world&mdash;O God! spare me a long life
that I may make amends.&nbsp; Every hour, every minute of it shall be
devoted to your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he stood there, with his eager boyish eyes upraised, a light seemed
to fall upon his face and illumine it.&nbsp; I had pushed the photograph
back to him, and it lay upon the table before him.&nbsp; He knelt and
pressed his lips to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your help, my darling, and His,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>The next morning he was married.&nbsp; She was a well-meaning girl,
though her piety, as is the case with most people, was of the negative
order; and her antipathy to things evil much stronger than her sympathy
with things good.&nbsp; For a longer time than I had expected she kept
him straight&mdash;perhaps a little too straight.&nbsp; But at last
there came the inevitable relapse.</p>
<p>I called upon him, in answer to an excited message, and found him
in the depths of despair.&nbsp; It was the old story, human weakness,
combined with lamentable lack of the most ordinary precautions against
being found out.&nbsp; He gave me details, interspersed with exuberant
denunciations of himself, and I undertook the delicate task of peace-maker.</p>
<p>It was a weary work, but eventually she consented to forgive him.&nbsp;
His joy, when I told him, was boundless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good women are,&rdquo; he said, while the tears came into
his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she shall not repent it.&nbsp; Please God,
from this day forth, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and for the first time in his life the doubt of himself
crossed his mind.&nbsp; As I sat watching him, the joy died out of his
face, and the first hint of age passed over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to have been &lsquo;tidying up and starting afresh&rsquo;
all my life,&rdquo; he said wearily; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to see
where the untidiness lies, and the only way to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not understand the meaning of his words at the time, but learnt
it later on.</p>
<p>He strove, according to his strength, and fell.&nbsp; But by a miracle
his transgression was not discovered.&nbsp; The facts came to light
long afterwards, but at the time there were only two who knew.</p>
<p>It was his last failure.&nbsp; Late one evening I received a hurriedly-scrawled
note from his wife, begging me to come round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible thing has happened,&rdquo; it ran; &ldquo;Charley
went up to his study after dinner, saying he had some &lsquo;tidying
up,&rsquo; as he calls it, to do, and did not wish to be disturbed.&nbsp;
In clearing out his desk he must have handled carelessly the revolver
that he always keeps there, not remembering, I suppose, that it was
loaded.&nbsp; We heard a report, and on rushing into the room found
him lying dead on the floor.&nbsp; The bullet had passed right through
his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly the type of man for a hero!&nbsp; And yet I do not know.&nbsp;
Perhaps he fought harder than many a man who conquers.&nbsp; In the
world&rsquo;s courts, we are compelled to judge on circumstantial evidence
only, and the chief witness, the man&rsquo;s soul, cannot very well
be called.</p>
<p>I remember the subject of bravery being discussed one evening at
a dinner party, when a German gentleman present related an anecdote,
the hero of which was a young Prussian officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot give you his name,&rdquo; our German friend explained&mdash;&ldquo;the
man himself told me the story in confidence; and though he personally,
by virtue of his after record, could afford to have it known, there
are other reasons why it should not be bruited about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I learnt it was in this way.&nbsp; For a dashing exploit
performed during the brief war against Austria he had been presented
with the Iron Cross.&nbsp; This, as you are well aware, is the most
highly-prized decoration in our army; men who have earned it are usually
conceited about it, and, indeed, have some excuse for being so.&nbsp;
He, on the contrary, kept his locked in a drawer of his desk, and never
wore it except when compelled by official etiquette.&nbsp; The mere
sight of it seemed to be painful to him.&nbsp; One day I asked him the
reason.&nbsp; We are very old and close friends, and he told me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The incident occurred when he was a young lieutenant.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was his first engagement.&nbsp; By some means or another
he had become separated from his company, and, unable to regain it,
had attached himself to a line regiment stationed at the extreme right
of the Prussian lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enemy&rsquo;s effort was mainly directed against the left
centre, and for a while our young lieutenant was nothing more than a
distant spectator of the battle.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, the attack
shifted, and the regiment found itself occupying an extremely important
and critical position.&nbsp; The shells began to fall unpleasantly near,
and the order was given to &lsquo;grass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men fell upon their faces and waited.&nbsp; The shells
ploughed the ground around them, smothering them with dirt.&nbsp; A
horrible, griping pain started in my young friend&rsquo;s stomach, and
began creeping upwards.&nbsp; His head and heart both seemed to be shrinking
and growing cold.&nbsp; A shot tore off the head of the man next to
him, sending the blood spurting into his face; a minute later another
ripped open the back of a poor fellow lying to the front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His body seemed not to belong to himself at all.&nbsp; A strange,
shrivelled creature had taken possession of it.&nbsp; He raised his
head and peered about him.&nbsp; He and three soldiers&mdash;youngsters,
like himself, who had never before been under fire&mdash;appeared to
be utterly alone in that hell.&nbsp; They were the end men of the regiment,
and the configuration of the ground completely hid them from their comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They glanced at each other, these four, and read one another&rsquo;s
thoughts.&nbsp; Leaving their rifles lying on the grass, they commenced
to crawl stealthily upon their bellies, the lieutenant leading, the
other three following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some few hundred yards in front of them rose a small, steep
hill.&nbsp; If they could reach this it would shut them out of sight.&nbsp;
They hastened on, pausing every thirty yards or so to lie still and
pant for breath, then hurrying on again, quicker than before, tearing
their flesh against the broken ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last they reached the base of the slope, and slinking a
little way round it, raised their heads and looked back.&nbsp; Where
they were it was impossible for them to be seen from the Prussian lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sprang to their feet and broke into a wild race.&nbsp;
A dozen steps further they came face to face with an Austrian field
battery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demon that had taken possession of them had been growing
stronger the further they had fled.&nbsp; They were not men, they were
animals mad with fear.&nbsp; Driven by the same frenzy that prompted
other panic-stricken creatures to once rush down a steep place into
the sea, these four men, with a yell, flung themselves, sword in hand,
upon the whole battery; and the whole battery, bewildered by the suddenness
and unexpectedness of the attack, thinking the entire battalion was
upon them, gave way, and rushed pell-mell down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the sight of those flying Austrians the fear, as independently
as it had come to him, left him, and he felt only a desire to hack and
kill.&nbsp; The four Prussians flew after them, cutting and stabbing
at them as they ran; and when the Prussian cavalry came thundering up,
they found my young lieutenant and his three friends had captured two
guns and accounted for half a score of the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day, he was summoned to headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you be good enough to remember for the future,
sir,&rsquo; said the Chief of the Staff, &lsquo;that His Majesty does
not require his lieutenants to execute manoeuvres on their own responsibility,
and also that to attack a battery with three men is not war, but damned
tomfoolery.&nbsp; You ought to be court-martialled, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in somewhat different tones, the old soldier added,
his face softening into a smile: &lsquo;However, alertness and daring,
my young friend, are good qualities, especially when crowned with success.&nbsp;
If the Austrians had once succeeded in planting a battery on that hill
it might have been difficult to dislodge them.&nbsp; Perhaps, under
the circumstances, His Majesty may overlook your indiscretion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His Majesty not only overlooked it, but bestowed upon
me the Iron Cross,&rsquo; concluded my friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;For the
credit of the army, I judged it better to keep quiet and take it.&nbsp;
But, as you can understand, the sight of it does not recall very pleasurable
reflections.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>To return to my diary, I see that on November 14th we held another
meeting.&nbsp; But at this there were present only &ldquo;Jephson, MacShaughnassy,
and Self&rdquo;; and of Brown&rsquo;s name I find henceforth no further
trace.&nbsp; On Christmas eve we three met again, and my notes inform
me that MacShaughnassy brewed some whiskey-punch, according to a recipe
of his own, a record suggestive of a sad Christmas for all three of
us.&nbsp; No particular business appears to have been accomplished on
either occasion.</p>
<p>Then there is a break until February 8th, and the assemblage has
shrunk to &ldquo;Jephson and Self.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a final flicker,
as of a dying candle, my diary at this point, however, grows luminous,
shedding much light upon that evening&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Our talk seems to have been of many things&mdash;of most things,
in fact, except our novel.&nbsp; Among other subjects we spoke of literature
generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired of this eternal cackle about books,&rdquo; said
Jephson; &ldquo;these columns of criticism to every line of writing;
these endless books about books; these shrill praises and shrill denunciations;
this silly worship of novelist Tom; this silly hate of poet Dick; this
silly squabbling over playwright Harry.&nbsp; There is no soberness,
no sense in it all.&nbsp; One would think, to listen to the High Priests
of Culture, that man was made for literature, not literature for man.&nbsp;
Thought existed before the Printing Press; and the men who wrote the
best hundred books never read them.&nbsp; Books have their place in
the world, but they are not its purpose.&nbsp; They are things side
by side with beef and mutton, the scent of the sea, the touch of a hand,
the memory of a hope, and all the other items in the sum-total of our
three-score years and ten.&nbsp; Yet we speak of them as though they
were the voice of Life instead of merely its faint echo.&nbsp; Tales
are delightful <i>as</i> tales&mdash;sweet as primroses after the long
winter, restful as the cawing of rooks at sunset.&nbsp; But we do not
write &lsquo;tales&rsquo; now; we prepare &lsquo;human documents&rsquo;
and dissect souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly in the midst of his tirade.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you know what these &lsquo;psychological studies,&rsquo; that are so
fashionable just now, always make me think of?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One monkey examining another monkey for fleas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what, after all, does our dissecting pen lay bare?&rdquo;
he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Human nature? or merely some more or less
unsavoury undergarment, disguising and disfiguring human nature?&nbsp;
There is a story told of an elderly tramp, who, overtaken by misfortune,
was compelled to retire for a while to the seclusion of Portland.&nbsp;
His hosts, desiring to see as much as possible of their guest during
his limited stay with them, proceeded to bath him.&nbsp; They bathed
him twice a day for a week, each time learning more of him; until at
last they reached a flannel shirt.&nbsp; And with that they had to be
content, soap and water proving powerless to go further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tramp appears to me symbolical of mankind.&nbsp; Human
Nature has worn its conventions for so long that its habit has grown
on to it.&nbsp; In this nineteenth century it is impossible to say where
the clothes of custom end and the natural man begins.&nbsp; Our virtues
are taught to us as a branch of &lsquo;Deportment&rsquo;; our vices
are the recognised vices of our reign and set.&nbsp; Our religion hangs
ready-made beside our cradle to be buttoned upon us by loving hands.&nbsp;
Our tastes we acquire, with difficulty; our sentiments we learn by rote.&nbsp;
At cost of infinite suffering, we study to love whiskey and cigars,
high art and classical music.&nbsp; In one age we admire Byron and drink
sweet champagne: twenty years later it is more fashionable to prefer
Shelley, and we like our champagne dry.&nbsp; At school we are told
that Shakespeare is a great poet, and that the Venus di Medici is a
fine piece of sculpture; and so for the rest of our lives we go about
saying what a great poet we think Shakespeare, and that there is no
piece of sculpture, in our opinion, so fine as the Venus di Medici.&nbsp;
If we are Frenchmen we adore our mother; if Englishmen we love dogs
and virtue.&nbsp; We grieve for the death of a near relative twelve
months; but for a second cousin we sorrow only three.&nbsp; The good
man has his regulation excellencies to strive after, his regulation
sins to repent of.&nbsp; I knew a good man who was quite troubled because
he was not proud, and could not, therefore, with any reasonableness,
pray for humility.&nbsp; In society one must needs be cynical and mildly
wicked: in Bohemia, orthodoxly unorthodox.&nbsp; I remember my mother
expostulating with a friend, an actress, who had left a devoted husband
and eloped with a disagreeable, ugly, little low comedian (I am speaking
of long, long ago).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must be mad,&rsquo; said my mother; &lsquo;what
on earth induced you to take such a step?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Emma,&rsquo; replied the lady; &lsquo;what
else was there for me?&nbsp; You know I can&rsquo;t act.&nbsp; I had
to do <i>something</i> to show I was &lsquo;an artiste!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are dressed-up marionettes.&nbsp; Our voice is the voice
of the unseen showman, Convention; our very movements of passion and
pain are but in answer to his jerk.&nbsp; A man resembles one of those
gigantic bundles that one sees in nursemaids&rsquo; arms.&nbsp; It is
very bulky and very long; it looks a mass of delicate lace and rich
fur and fine woven stuffs; and somewhere, hidden out of sight among
the finery, there is a tiny red bit of bewildered humanity, with no
voice but a foolish cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one story,&rdquo; he went on, after a long pause,
uttering his own thoughts aloud rather than speaking to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
sit at our desks and think and think, and write and write, but the story
is ever the same.&nbsp; Men told it and men listened to it many years
ago; we are telling it to one another to-day; we shall be telling it
to one another a thousand years hence; and the story is: &lsquo;Once
upon a time there lived a man, and a woman who loved him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The little critic cries that it is not new, and asks for something fresh,
thinking&mdash;as children do&mdash;that there are strange things in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>At that point my notes end, and there is nothing in the book beyond.&nbsp;
Whether any of us thought any more of the novel, whether we ever met
again to discuss it, whether it were ever begun, whether it were ever
abandoned&mdash;I cannot say.&nbsp; There is a fairy story that I read
many, many years ago that has never ceased to haunt me.&nbsp; It told
how a little boy once climbed a rainbow.&nbsp; And at the end of the
rainbow, just behind the clouds, he found a wondrous city.&nbsp; Its
houses were of gold, and its streets were paved with silver, and the
light that shone upon it was as the light that lies upon the sleeping
world at dawn.&nbsp; In this city there were palaces so beautiful that
merely to look upon them satisfied all desires; temples so perfect that
they who once knelt therein were cleansed of sin.&nbsp; And all the
men who dwelt in this wondrous city were great and good, and the women
fairer than the women of a young man&rsquo;s dreams.&nbsp; And the name
of the city was, &ldquo;The city of the things men meant to do.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
